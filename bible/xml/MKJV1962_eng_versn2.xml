    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it happened in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and men of Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they said to me, The remnant left of the captivity there in the province [is] in great affliction and shame. And the wall of Jerusalem [is] broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it happened when I heard these words, I sat down and wept. And I mourned [for] days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of Heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I said, I pray You, O LORD God of Heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and mercy for those who love Him and keep His commandments;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">let Your ear now be open, and Your eyes open, so that You may hear the prayer of Your servant, which I pray before You now, day and night, for the sons of Israel Your servants, and confessing the sins of the sons of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both I and my father's house have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have acted very wickedly against You, and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which You commanded Your servant Moses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I pray You, remember the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, [If] you sin, I will scatter you among the nations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">but [if] you turn to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though you were cast out to the outermost part of the heavens, [yet] I will gather you from there and will bring you to the place that I have chosen to set My name there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And these [are] Your servants and Your people whom You have redeemed by Your great power and by Your strong hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">O LORD, I pray You, let now Your ear be open to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name. And I pray You, bless Your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. (For I was the king's cupbearer.)</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it happened in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, wine [was] before him. And I took up the wine and gave [it] to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence before.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king said to me, Why [is] your face sad, since you [are] not sick? This [is] nothing but sorrow of heart. Then I was very much afraid.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And [I] said to the king, Let the king live forever. Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' tombs, [lies] waste, and its gates are burned with fire?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said to me, For what do you ask? So I prayed to the God of Heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and I said to the king, If it please the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I pray that you would send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' tombs, so that I may build it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors Beyond the River, so that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the kings forest, so that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [belong] to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house into which I shall enter. And the king granted me what I asked, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I came to the governors of [the province] Beyond the River and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me. And I did not tell to a man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem. And [there was] no animal with me, except the animal that I rode upon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I went out by night by the Valley Gate, even before the Jackal Fountain, and to the Dung Gate, and looked at the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down, and its gates which were burned with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I went on to the Fountain Gate, and to the King's Pool. But [there was] no place for the animal that was under me to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I went up in the night by the brook and looked at the wall, and turned back, and entered by the Valley Gate, and returned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the rulers did not know where I had gone, nor what I was doing. Nor had I told the Jews as yet, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I said to them, You see the distress that we [are] in, how Jerusalem is wasted, and the gates of it are burned with fire. Come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, so that we may no more be a reproach.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, and also the king's words that he had spoken to me. And they said, Let us rise up to build. So they made their hands strong for good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us. And they said, What [is] this that you do? Will you rebel against the king?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I answered them and said to them, The God of Heaven, He will bless us, and we, His servants, will arise and build. But you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they make an end in a day? Will they bring to life the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Tobiah the Ammonite [was] beside him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox goes up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Oh our God, hear, for we are despised. And turn their curse upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">So we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together to the half of it. For the people had a mind to work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And it happened, when Sanballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem had gone up, [and] that the breaks were being filled, they were very angry.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And my heart within myself ruled, and I rebuked the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, You exact interest, [each] one from his brother. And I held a great gathering against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said to them, According to our ability we have redeemed our brothers, the Jews who were sold to the nations. And will you even sell your brothers? Or shall they be sold to us? And they were silent and did not find an answer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I said, What you do [is] not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And also I, my brothers and my servants, might take from them silver and grain. Please let us leave this lending at interest.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! all [is] vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What [is] the profit to a man in all his labor which he labors under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">A generation passes away, and a generation comes; but the earth remains forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sun also arises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it arose.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">All things [are] full of labor; man cannot utter it; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That which has been [is] that which shall be; and that which has been done [is] that which shall be done; and [there is] nothing new under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is there a thing [of] which it may be said, See, this [is] new? It has already been in days of old, which were before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">[There is] no memory of former [things], and also no memory] of after [things] which shall be; for neither shall be a remembrance of them with those who will be at the afterwards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all which is done under the heavens. [It is] a sad task God has given to the sons of men to be humbled by it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What [is] crooked cannot be made straight; and [that] lacking cannot be numbered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I spoke within my own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have gathered more wisdom than all that have been before me in Jerusalem; yea, my heart has seen much of wisdom and knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly; I know that this also [is] vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in much wisdom [is] much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I said in my heart, Come now, I will test you with mirth; therefore consider and behold goodness; this also [is] vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of laughter, [It is] madness; and of mirth, What does it do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I sought in my heart to drag my flesh with wine, yet leading my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, until I might see where the good for the sons of men might be, what they should do under the heavens all the days of their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made my works great; I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I made gardens and orchards for myself, And I planted trees in them, of all fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I made pools of water for myself, to water the forest shooting forth trees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I bought slaves and slave women, and sons of the house were mine; also livestock, a herd and a great flock were mine, above all that were before me in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I also gathered silver and gold to myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got men singers and women singers for myself, and the delights of the sons of men, a wife and very many wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem; also my wisdom remained with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor, and this was my part of all my labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had done, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit; and [there is] no profit under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I turned to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly; for what [can] the man [do] who comes after the king, when they have already done it?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore I hated life; because the work that is done under the sun [is] sad to me; for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yes, I hated all my labor which I had done under the sun; that I must leave it to the man who shall be after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And who knows [whether] he shall be wise or a fool? Yet he shall have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and acted wisely under the sun. This [is] also vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And I turned to cause my heart to despair over all the labor which I did under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and with success; yet to a man who has not labored in it, he shall leave it [for] his share. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what has man from all his labor, and from the troubling of his heart, in which he has labored under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days [are] sorrows, and his labor sadness; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This [is] also vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Is it not good that he should eat and drink and make his soul see good in his labor? This I also saw, that it [was] from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who can eat, or who can enjoy, apart from me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For [God] gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy to a man who [is] good in His sight. But to the sinner He gives labor, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him who is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked; for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I said in my heart concerning the matter of sons of men, that God might reveal them, and that they might see that they themselves [are] beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For that which happens [to] the sons of men also happens to beasts even one thing [happens] to them. As this [one] dies, so that [one] dies; yea, they all [have] one breath; so that a man has no advantage over a beast; for all [is] vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who knows the spirit of man [that] goes upward, and the spirit of the beast [that] goes downward?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore I have seen that [there is] nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion; for who can bring him to see what shall be after him?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">And it happened when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded [him] to speak to all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, You shall surely die!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be wasted, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">When the rulers of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD's [house].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the priests and the prophets spoke to the rulers and to all the people, saying, [Let] a death sentence be for this man, for he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Jeremiah spoke to all the rulers and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">But know for certain that if you put me to death you shall surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city, and on its people. For truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets, There [is] not a sentence of death for this man; for he has spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, So says Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be plowed [like] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house like the high places of a forest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah indeed put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD, and pray to the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which He had spoken against them? So we are doing great evil against our souls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the rulers, heard his words, the king tried to put him to death. But when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled and went into Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which [was] the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem. And Jeremiah the prophet was shut in the court of the guard, which [was] in the king of Judah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do you prophesy and say, So says the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and he shall lead Zedekiah into Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says the LORD; though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not be blessed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jeremiah said, The Word of the LORD came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum your uncle shall come to you, saying, Buy for yourself my field in Anathoth; for the right to redeem it [is] yours, to buy [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD and said to me, Please buy my field in Anathoth, which [is] in the land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance [is] yours, and the right to redeem [is] yours. Buy [it] for yourself. Then I knew that this [was] the word of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I bought the field in Anathoth, of Hanameel my uncle's son, and weighed him the silver, seventeen shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I wrote it in the document, and sealed [it], and called witnesses, and weighed the silver in the scales.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I took the document of the purchase, that which was sealed [according] to the law and custom, and the open copy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I gave the document of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, before the eyes of Hanameel my uncle's [son], and before the eyes of the witnesses who wrote in the purchase document, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I commanded Baruch before them, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these books, the purchase document, the one sealed and the open book, and put them in an earthen vessel so that they may stand many days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For so says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall be owned again in this land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And after I gave the purchase document to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ah, Lord Jehovah! You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and stretched out arm. Nothing is too great for You.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">You show loving-kindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them. The great, the mighty God, Jehovah of hosts, [is] His name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">great in wisdom and mighty in work; for Your eyes [are] open on all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, until this day, and in Israel, and among men; and have made You a name, as at this day;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and have brought forth Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And You have given them this land, which You swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they came in and possessed it, but they did not obey Your voice, nor did they walk in Your law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this evil to come on them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Behold, the siege mounds have come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the plague. And what You have spoken has happened; and, behold, You saw [it].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And You have said to me, O Lord Jehovah, Buy the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Then the Word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore so says the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come up and set this city on fire, and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have only done evil before Me from their youth. For the sons of Israel have only provoked Me to anger with the work of their hands, says the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For this city has been to Me as a cause of My anger and of My fury from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before My face</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger, they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they have turned the back to Me, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching [them], yet they have not listened to receive instruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they built the high places of Baal, in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And now therefore, so says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the plague:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Behold, I will gather them out of all the lands where I have driven them in My anger, and in My fury, and in great wrath. And I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for their good and for the good of their sons after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I will cut an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good. But I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will truly plant them in this land with all My heart and all My whole soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For so says the LORD: As I have brought all this great evil on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And fields shall be bought in this land of which you say, [It is] a desert without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Men shall buy fields for silver, and write it in a book, and seal [it], and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south.

      <VERS vnumber="4">For so says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down [to defend] against the siege-mounds and against the sword:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">They come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I have slain in My anger and in My fury, and for all whose evil I have hidden My face from this city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Behold, I will bring it health and healing, and I will heal them and will show them the riches of peace and truth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">So says the LORD: Again there shall be heard in this place, which you say [is] a waste without man and without beast, [even] in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth (because his hand rules) and all the peoples, fought against Jerusalem and against all its cities; saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">At the end of seven years each man should let go his brother, a Hebrew, and who has been sold to him. And when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you. But your fathers did not listen to me, nor bow down their ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And you had turned today, and had done right in My sight to call for liberty, each man to his neighbor. And you had cut a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">Yea, so that the LORD could no longer hold back because of the evil of your doings, because of the abominations which you have committed! So your land is a waste, and a wonder, and a curse, without anyone in it, as [it is] today.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Because you have burned incense, and because you have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, [nor walked] in His law, nor in His statutes, nor did you walk in His testimonies, therefore this evil has happened to you, as at this day.</VERS>

You will surely fulfil your vows and surely carry out your vows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Therefore hear the Word of the LORD, all Judah that lives in the land of Egypt. Behold, I have sworn by My great name, says the LORD, that My name will no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord Jehovah lives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good. And all the men of Judah in the land of Egypt shall be destroyed by the sword and by the famine, until there is an end of them.</VERS>
