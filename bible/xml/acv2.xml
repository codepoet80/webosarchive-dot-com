    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom. And Jehovah his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every ruler in all Israel, the heads of the fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon. For the tent of meeting of God was there, which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the ark of God David had brought up from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it. For he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover the brazen altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah. And Solomon and the assembly sought to it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Solomon went up there to the brazen altar before Jehovah, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, Ask what I shall give thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Solomon said to God, Thou have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now, O Jehovah God, let thy promise to David my father be established. For thou have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people. For who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate thee, neither yet have asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou may judge my people over whom I have made thee king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee. And I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before thee, neither shall any after thee have the like.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem, and he reigned over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen. And he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars he made to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. The king's merchants received them in herds, each herd at a price.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they went after and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. And so they brought them out by their means for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Solomon purposed to build a house for the name of Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Solomon counted out seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men who were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou dealt with David my father, and sent him cedars to build for him a house to dwell therein, so with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual showbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God. This is an ordinance forever to Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the house which I build is great. For our God is great above all gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But who is able to build for him a house, seeing heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build for him a house, except only to burn incense before him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore send me a man skilful to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and who knows how to engrave engravings, to be with the skilful men who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Send to me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon. For I know that thy servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And, behold, my servants shall be with thy servants,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">even to prepare for me timber in abundance. For the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers who cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because Jehovah loves his people, he has made thee king over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Huram said moreover, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who has given to David the king a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, that should build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And now I have sent a skilful man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan. And his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson, also to engrave any manner of engraving, and to devise any device, that there may be a place appointed to him with thy skilful men, and with the skilful men of my lord David thy father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has spoken of, let him send to his servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shall need. And we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa, and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Solomon numbered all the aliens that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them. And they were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens, and eighty thousand who were hewers in the mountains, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people to work.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon began to build the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem on mount Moriah, where Jehovah appeared to David his father, which he made ready in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the porch that was before the house, the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height a hundred and twenty. And he overlaid it inside with pure gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the greater house he ceiled with fir-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and wrought thereon palm trees and chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty. And the gold was gold of Parvaim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">He also overlaid the house, the beams, the thresholds, and the walls of it, and the doors of it, with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he made the most holy house; the length of it, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the breadth of it twenty cubits. And he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And in the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work, and they overlaid them with gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long; the wing of the one was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits. And they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubim thereon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Also he made two pillars before the house of thirty-five cubits in length, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars. And he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. And called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length of it, and twenty cubits the breadth of it, and ten cubits the height of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Also he made the molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass. And the height of it was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And under it was the likeness of oxen, which compassed it round about for ten cubits, encompassing the sea round about. The oxen were in two rows, cast when it was cast.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east. And the sea was set upon them above, and all their hinder parts were inward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was a handbreadth thick. And the brim of it was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It received and held three thousand baths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He also made ten basins, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them. They washed in them such things as belonged to the burnt offering, but the sea was for the priests to wash in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he made the ten lampstands of gold according to the ordinance concerning them. And he set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made a hundred basins of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward, toward the south.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. So Huram made an end of doing the work that he wrought for king Solomon in the house of God:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">the two pillars, and the bowls, and the two capitals which were on the top of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">He also made the bases, and he made the lavers upon the bases,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Also the pots, and the shovels, and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels of it, Huram his father made of bright brass for king Solomon for the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">The king cast them in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance. For the weight of the brass could not be found out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of God, also the golden altar, and the tables on which was the showbread,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">and the lampstands with their lamps, to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold, and that perfect gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold. And as for the entry of the house, the inner doors of it for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, namely, of the temple, were of gold.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus all the work that Solomon wrought for the house of Jehovah was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, even the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels, and put them in the treasuries of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the rulers of the fathers of the sons of Israel, to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David, which is Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast, which was in the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And all the elders of Israel came. And the Levites took up the ark.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent. These the priests the Levites brought up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled to him, were before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and the staves of it above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the staves were so long that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle, but they were not seen outside. And there it is to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets which Moses put there at Horeb when Jehovah made a covenant with the sons of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it came to pass, when the priests came out of the holy place, (for all the priests that were present had sanctified themselves, and did not keep their divisions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Also the Levites who were the singers, all of them, even Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">it came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah. And when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of music, and praised Jehovah, saying, For he is good. For his loving kindness is forever, that the house was then filled with a cloud, even the house of Jehovah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud. For the glory of Jehovah filled the house of God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then Solomon spoke, Jehovah has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But I have built for thee a house of habitation, and a place for thee to dwell in forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king turned his face, and blessed all the assembly of Israel. And all the assembly of Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and has with his hands fulfilled it, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in that my name might be there. Neither did I choose any man to be ruler over my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But I have chosen Jerusalem that my name might be there. And have chosen David to be over my people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But Jehovah said to David my father, Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house for my name, thou did well that it was in thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Nevertheless thou shall not build the house, but thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Jehovah has performed his word that he spoke. For I have risen up in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as Jehovah promised, and have built the house for the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there I have set the ark in which is the covenant of Jehovah, which he made with the sons of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court. And upon it he stood, and knelt down upon his knees before all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he said, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven, or on earth, who keep covenant and loving kindness with thy servants, who walk before thee with all their heart,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">who have kept with thy servant David my father that which thou promised him. Yea, thou spoke with thy mouth, and have fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou have promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons take heed to their way, to walk in my law as thou have walked before me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now therefore, O Jehovah, the God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou spoke to thy servant David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. How much less this house which I have built!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet have thou respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hearken to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place of which thou have said that thou would put thy name there, to hearken to the prayer which thy servant shall pray toward this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place. Yea, hear thou from thy dwelling-place, even from heaven, and when thou hear forgive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">If a man sins against his neighbor, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and he comes and swears before thine altar in this house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, requiting the wicked, to bring his way upon his own head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And if thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gave to them and to their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">When the heavens are shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee, if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin when thou do afflict them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and send rain upon thy land, which thou have given to thy people for an inheritance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blight or mildew, locust or caterpillar, if their enemies besiege them in the land of their cities, whatever plague or whatever sickness there be,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">whatever prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, who shall know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and shall spread forth his hands toward this house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling-place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart thou know, (for thou, even thou only, know the hearts of the sons of men),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">that they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gave to our fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of thy people Israel, when he shall come from a far country for thy great name's sake, and thy mighty hand, and thine outstretched arm, when they shall come and pray toward this house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to thee for, that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">If thy people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way thou shall send them, and they pray to thee toward this city which thou have chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">then hear thou from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">If they sin against thee (for there is no man that sins not), and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">yet if they shall rethink themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and make supplication to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which thou gave to their fathers, and the city which thou have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">then hear thou from heaven, even from thy dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their case, and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">Now, O my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let thine ears be attendant to the prayer that is made in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Now therefore arise, O Jehovah God, into thy resting-place, thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests, O Jehovah God, be clothed with salvation, and let thy sanctified rejoice in goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">O Jehovah God, do not turn away the face of thine anointed. Remember thy loving kindnesses to David thy servant.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices. And the glory of Jehovah filled the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah, because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the sons of Israel looked on when the fire came down, and the glory of Jehovah was upon the house. And they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshiped, and gave thanks to Jehovah, saying, For he is good. For his loving kindness is forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the priests stood according to their offices, also the Levites with instruments of music of Jehovah, which David the king had made to give thanks to Jehovah (for his loving kindness is forever) when David praised by their ministry, and the priests sounded trumpets before them. And all Israel stood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah. For there he offered the burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Solomon held the feast at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly. For they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had shown to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah, and the king's house. And all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of Jehovah, and in his own house, he caused to prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">If I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">if my people, who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attend to the prayer that is made in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For now I have chosen and hallowed this house, that my name may be there forever, and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And as for thee, if thou will walk before me as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and will keep my statutes and mine ordinances,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them. And this house, which I have hallowed for my name, I will cast out of my sight, and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And this house, which is so high, everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land, and to this house?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And they shall answer, Because they forsook Jehovah, the God of their fathers, who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them; therefore he has brought all this evil upon them.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of Jehovah, and his own house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the sons of Israel to dwell there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah, and prevailed against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store-cities, which he built in Hamath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the lower, fortified cities, with walls, gates, and bars,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Baalath, and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and all the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">As for all the people who were left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, that were not of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">of their sons who were left after them in the land whom the sons of Israel did not consumed, of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But Solomon made no servants of the sons of Israel for his work, but they were men of war, and chief of his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And these were the chief officers of king Solomon, even two hundred and fifty that bore rule over the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house that he had built for her. For he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy in which the ark of Jehovah has come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah, which he had built before the porch,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">even as the duty of every day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the set feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he appointed, according to the ordinance of David his father, the divisions of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their offices, to praise, and to minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required, also the porters by their divisions at every gate. For so David the man of God had commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Now all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah, and until it was finished. So the house of Jehovah was completed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber, and to Eloth, on the seashore in the land of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Huram sent ships to him by the hands of his servants, and servants who had knowledge of the sea. And they came with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and fetched from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to test Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great caravan, and camels that bore spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she conversed with him of all that was in her heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Solomon answered to her all her questions. And there was not anything hid from Solomon that he did not answer her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and the food of his table, and the seating of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, also his cupbearers, and their apparel, and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah, there was no more spirit in her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">However I did not believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it. And, behold, the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me. Thou exceed the fame that I heard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Blessed be Jehovah thy God, who delighted in thee, to set thee on his throne to be king for Jehovah thy God. Because thy God loved Israel, to establish them forever, therefore he made thee king over them, to do justice and righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stones. Neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And also the servants of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king made of the algum trees terraces for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and psalteries for the singers. And there were none such seen before in the land of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides that which she had brought to the king. So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">besides that which the traders and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And king Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one buckler.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and supports on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the supports.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was accounted of nothing in the days of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For the king had ships that went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Once every three years the ships of Tarshish came, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And he ruled over all the kings from the River even to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they brought horses for Solomon out of Egypt, and out of all lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Rehoboam went to Shechem. For all Israel came to Shechem to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it, (for he was in Egypt, from where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thy father made our yoke grievous. Now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said to them, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel do ye give me to return an answer to this people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they spoke to him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men that grew up with him, who stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to them, What counsel do ye give, that we may return an answer to this people who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that thy father put upon us lighter?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the young men that grew up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall thou say to the people who spoke to thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter to us. Thus shall thou say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the king answered them roughly. And king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto. My father chastised you with whips, but I with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the king did not hearken to the people. For it was brought about by God, that Jehovah might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel. Now see to thine own house, David. So all Israel departed to their tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But as for the sons of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to task work. And the sons of Israel stoned him to death with stones. And king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Thus says Jehovah, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers. Return every man to his house. For this thing is of me. So they hearkened to the words of Jehovah, and returned from going against Jeroboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Beth-zur, and Soco, and Adullam,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">and Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fortified cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And he fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of victuals, and oil and wine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And in every city he put shields and spears, and made them exceedingly strong. And Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their border.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem. For Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest's office to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he appointed priests for him for the high places, and for the he-goats, and for the calves which he had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And after them, such as set their hearts to seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem out of all the tribes of Israel to sacrifice to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years. For they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Rehoboam took him a wife, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And she bore sons for him: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And after her he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom. And she bore for him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines. For he took eighteen wives, and thirty concubines, and begot twenty-eight sons and thirty daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the ruler among his brothers. For he intended to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And he dealt wisely, and dispersed all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. And he gave them provisions in abundance. And he sought for them many wives.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass, when the kingdom of Rehoboam was established, and he was strong, that he forsook the law of Jehovah, and all Israel with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had trespassed against Jehovah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">with twelve hundred chariots, and thirty thousand horsemen. And the people were without number who came with him out of Egypt: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he took the fortified cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam, and to the rulers of Judah, who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says Jehovah, Ye have forsaken me, therefore I have also left you in the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then the rulers of Israel and the king humbled themselves, and they said, Jehovah is righteous.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves, the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all away. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard that kept the door of the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it was so, that, as often as the king entered into the house of Jehovah, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned from him, so as not to destroy him altogether. And moreover in Judah there were good things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned. For Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he did that which was evil, because he did not set his heart to seek Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, after the manner of genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. And Abijah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">He reigned three years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men. And Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men who were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Should ye not know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And there were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young and tender-hearted, and could not withstand them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David, and ye are a great multitude, and there are with you the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Have ye not driven out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for you after the manner of the peoples of other lands? So that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him. And we have priests ministering to Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they burn to Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. Also they set the showbread in order upon the pure table, and the lampstand of gold with the lamps of it to burn every evening. For we keep the charge of Jehovah our God, but ye have forsaken him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O sons of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers. For ye shall not prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come around behind them, so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them. And they cried to Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then the men of Judah gave a shout. And as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter. So there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thus the sons of Israel were brought under at that time, and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns of it, and Jeshanah with the towns of it, and Ephron with the towns of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah. And Jehovah smote him, and he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But Abijah grew mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and begot twenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Jehovah his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images. And the kingdom was quiet before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he built fortified cities in Judah. For the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Jehovah had given him rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Jehovah our God. We have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand, and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand. All these were mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a million, and three hundred chariots. And he came to Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Asa cried to Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, O Jehovah our God. For we rely on thee, and in thy name we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou are our God. Let not man prevail against thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah. And the Ethiopians fled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. And there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves. For they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his army. And they carried away very much booty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar. For the fear of Jehovah came upon them. And they despoiled all the cities. For there was much spoil in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">They also smote the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin. Jehovah is with you while ye are with him. And if ye seek him, he will be found of you, but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But when in their distress they turned to Jehovah, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And in those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city. For God vexed them with all adversity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But be ye strong, and let not your hands be slack. For your work shall be rewarded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill-country of Ephraim. And he renewed the altar of Jehovah, that was before the porch of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who sojourned with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon, for they came to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And they sacrificed to Jehovah in that day of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they entered into the covenant to seek Jehovah, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And that whoever would not seek Jehovah, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they swore to Jehovah with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And all Judah rejoiced at the oath. For they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire, and he was found by them. And Jehovah gave them rest round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And also he removed Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah. And Asa cut down her image, and made dust of it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">But the high places were not taken away out of Israel. Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And there was no more war to the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="16">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king's house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There is a league between me and thee, as between my father and thy father. Behold, I have sent thee silver and gold. Go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel that he may depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel. And they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtali.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it came to pass, when Baasha heard of it, that he left off building Ramah, and let his work cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber of it, with which Baasha had built. And he built Geba and Mizpah with it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, Because thou have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Jehovah thy God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and horsemen exceedingly many? Yet, because thou relied on Jehovah, he delivered them into thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him. In this thou have done foolishly, for from henceforth thou shall have wars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison-house. For he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet. His disease was exceedingly great, yet in his disease he did not seek for Jehovah, but to the physicians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forty-first year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers' art. And they made a very great burning for him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="17">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the former ways of his father David, and did not seek for the Baalim,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">but sought for the God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Therefore Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat tribute, and he had riches and honor in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And his heart was lifted up in the ways of Jehovah. And furthermore he took away the high places and the Asherim out of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Also in the third year of his reign he sent his rulers, even Ben-hail, and Obadiah, and Zechariah, and Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, the Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And they taught in Judah, having the book of the law of Jehovah with them. And they went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught among the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the fear of Jehovah fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and silver for tribute. The Arabians also brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehoshaphat grew exceedingly great. And he built in Judah castles and cities of storage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he had many works in the cities of Judah, and men of war, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And this was the numbering of them according to their fathers' houses. Of Judah, the captains of thousands: Adnah the captain, and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valor;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and next to him Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to Jehovah, and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And of Benjamin: Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and next to him Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand ready prepared for war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">These were those who waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="18">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance. And he joined affinity with Ahab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people who were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Will thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou are, and my people as thy people, and will be with thee in the war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up. For God will deliver it into the hand of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we may inquire of him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah, but I hate him. For he never prophesies good concerning me, but always evil; the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah each sat on his throne, arrayed in their robes. And they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for him horns of iron, and said, Thus says Jehovah, With these thou shall push the Syrians until they be consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper. For Jehovah will deliver it into the hand of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets are good to the king with one mouth. Let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Micaiah said, As Jehovah lives, what my God says, that will I speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And when he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Jehovah?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master. Let them return every man to his house in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Micaiah said, Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah. I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing at his right hand and at his left.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah, and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said to him, With what?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shall entice him, and shall also prevail. Go forth, and do so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Now therefore, behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets. And Jehovah has spoken evil concerning thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way did the Spirit of Jehovah go from me to speak to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shall see on that day when thou shall go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into the battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned around to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried out. And Jehovah helped him, and God moved them from him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army. For I am severely wounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the battle increased that day. However the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening. And about the time of the going down of the sun he died.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="19">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should thou help the wicked, and love those who hate Jehovah? For this thing wrath is upon thee from before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou have put away the Asheroth out of the land, and have set thy heart to seek God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem. And he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and said to the judges, Consider what ye do. For ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah, and he is with you in the judgment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now therefore let the fear of Jehovah be upon you. Take heed and do it. For there is no iniquity with Jehovah our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Moreover in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat set from the Levites and the priests, and from the heads of the fathers of Israel for the judgment of Jehovah, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he charged them, saying, Thus ye shall do in the fear of Jehovah, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And whenever any controversy shall come to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brothers. Do this, and ye shall not be guilty.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king's matters. The Levites shall also be officers before you. Deal courageously, and Jehovah be with the good.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="20">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass after this, that the sons of Moab, and the sons of Ammon, and with them some of the Minaeans, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then there came some who told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea from Syria. And, behold, they are in Hazazon-tamar (the same is En-gedi).</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehoshaphat was afraid, and set himself to seek for Jehovah. And he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Judah gathered themselves together, to seek help from Jehovah, even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of Jehovah before the new court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said, O Jehovah, the God of our fathers, are thou not God in heaven? And are thou not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? And in thy hand is power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Did thou not, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and give it to the seed of Abraham thy friend forever?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they dwelt therein, and have built for thee a sanctuary in it for thy name, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If evil comes upon us, the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house, and before thee, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry out to thee in our affliction, and thou will hear and save.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And now, behold, the sons of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir (whom thou would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned aside from them, and did not destroy them),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">behold, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou have given us to inherit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">O our God, will thou not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us. Neither do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And all Judah stood before Jehovah, with their little ones, their wives, and their sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, the Levite, of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of Jehovah in the midst of the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat. Thus says Jehovah to you, Fear ye not, neither be dismayed because of this great multitude. For the battle is not yours, but God's.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Tomorrow go ye down against them. Behold, they come up by the ascent of Ziz. And ye shall find them at the end of the valley, before the wilderness of Jeruel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ye shall not need to fight in this battle. Set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Fear not, nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, for Jehovah is with you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground. And all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah, worshiping Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise Jehovah, the God of Israel, with an exceedingly loud voice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa. And as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established. Believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when he had taken counsel with the people, he appointed those who should sing to Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks to Jehovah. For his loving kindness is forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set an ambushment against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir who came against Judah, and they were smitten.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For the sons of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, to slay and destroy them utterly. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another of themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude. And, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none who escaped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches and dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away. And they were three days in taking the spoil, it was so much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Beracah, for there they blessed Jehovah. Therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Beracah to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy. For Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets to the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet. For his God gave him rest round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to reign. And he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and did not turn aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">However the high places were not taken away. Neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is inserted in the book of the kings of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel. The same did very wickedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish. And they made the ships in Ezion-geber.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou have joined thyself with Ahaziah, Jehovah has destroyed thy works. And the ships were broken, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="21">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he had brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah. All these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judah. But the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, because he was the firstborn.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now when Jehoram was risen up over the kingdom of his father, and had strengthened himself, he killed all his brothers with the sword, and also various of the rulers of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife. And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">However Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons always.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jehoram passed over with his captains, and all his chariots with him. And he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites that encompassed him around, and the captains of the chariots.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand because he had forsaken Jehovah, the God of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, and led Judah astray.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus says Jehovah, the God of David thy father, Because thou have not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the harlot, like the house of Ahab did, and also have slain thy brothers of thy father's house who were better than thyself,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">behold, Jehovah will smite thy people with a great plague, and thy sons, and thy wives, and all thy substance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And thou shall have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness, day by day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians who are beside the Ethiopians.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And they came up against Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives, so that there has not been left a son to him, except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And after all this Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass, in process of time, at the end of two years, that his bowels fell out because of his sickness, and he died of severe diseases. And his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. And he departed without being wanted. And they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchers of the kings.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="22">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead, for the band of men who came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab. For his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, as did the house of Ahab. For they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram, for when he came he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, that he found the rulers of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and killed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria). And they brought him to Jehu, and killed him. And they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And he was with them hid in the house of God six years, and Athaliah reigned over the land.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the heads of fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And all the assembly made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said to them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as Jehovah has spoken concerning the sons of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">This is the thing that ye shall do: A third part of you who come in on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the thresholds,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">So the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And they took every man his men, those who were to come in on the sabbath, with those who were to go out on the sabbath. For Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the divisions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds the spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David's, which were in the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he set all the people, every man with his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then they brought out the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. And they said, Live, O king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And she looked, and, behold, the king stood by his pillar at the entrance, and the captains and the trumpets by the king. And all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. The singers also played on instruments of music, and led the singing of praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and said, Treason! treason!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, Have her forth between the ranks. And whoever follows her, let him be slain with the sword, for the priest said, Do not slay her in the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So they made way for her. And she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king's house, and they killed her there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, and all the people, and the king, that they should be Jehovah's people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And all the people went to the house of Baal, and broke it down, and broke his altars and his images in pieces, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Jehoiada appointed the officers of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of Jehovah, to offer the burnt offerings of Jehovah, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, according to the order of David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And he set the porters at the gates of the house of Jehovah that no man who was unclean in anything should enter in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And he took the captains of hundreds, and the mighty men, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah. And they came through the upper gate to the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. And they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Zibiah, of Beersheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Joash did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he begot sons and daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to restore the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out to the cities of Judah, and gather money from all Israel to repair the house of your God from year to year. And see that ye hasten the matter. However the Levites did not hasten it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said to him, Why have thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tax of Moses the servant of Jehovah, and of the assembly of Israel, for the tent of the testimony?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God, and also all the dedicated things of the house of Jehovah they bestowed upon the Baalim.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And all the rulers and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And it was so, that, at what ever time the chest was brought to the king's officers by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the chief priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to its place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah. And they hired masons and carpenters to restore the house of Jehovah, and also such as wrought iron and brass to repair the house of Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">And when they had made an end, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, from which were made vessels for the house of Jehovah, even vessels with which to minister and to offer, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died. He was a hundred and thirty years old when he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, and toward God and his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now after the death of Jehoiada the rulers of Judah came, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened to them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest.

      <VERS vnumber="21">And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="25">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan, of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But he did not put their sons to death, but did according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses, as Jehovah commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the sons, neither shall the sons die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and appointed them according to their fathers' houses, for heads of thousands and heads of hundreds, even all Judah and Benjamin. And he numbered them from twenty years old and upward, and found them three hundred thousand chosen men, able to go forth to war, who could handle spear and shield.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">He also hired a hundred thousand mighty men of valor out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee. For Jehovah is not with Israel, namely, with all the sons of Ephraim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But if thou are going, do it. Be strong for the battle, because God will cast thee down before the enemy, for God has power to help, and to cast down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Amaziah separated them, namely, the army that came to him out of Ephraim, to go home again. Therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and smote ten thousand of the sons of Seir.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the sons of Judah carried away ten thousand alive, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were broken in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Now it came to pass, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Therefore the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah. And he sent a prophet to him, who said to him, Why have thou sought after the gods of the people, which have not delivered their own people out of thy hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said to him, Have we made thee of the king's counsel? Cease. Why should thou be smitten? Then the prophet ceased, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy thee, because thou have done this, and have not hearkened to my counsel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look each other in the face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife. And there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trampled down the thistle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thou say, Lo, I have smitten Edom. And thy heart lifts thee up to boast. Remain now at home. Why should thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou should fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">But Amaziah would not hear, for it was of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So Joash king of Israel went up. And he and Amaziah king of Judah looked each other in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, also the hostages, and returned to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Jehovah they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But they sent after him to Lachish, and killed him there.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">and said to them, Ye shall not bring in the captives here. For ye propose that which will bring upon us a trespass against Jehovah, to add to our sins and to our trespass. For our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the rulers and all the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them, and dressed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers. Then they returned to Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns of it, and Timnah with the towns of it, also Gimzo and the towns of it. And they dwelt there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For Jehovah brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed severely against Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but did not strengthen him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Jehovah, and out of the house of the king and of the rulers, and gave it to the king of Assyria, but it did not help him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And in the time of his distress he trespassed yet more against Jehovah, this same king Ahaz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which smote him. And he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, therefore I will sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah. And he made altars for him in every corner of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah, the God of his fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem. For they did not bring him into the sepulchers of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="29">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he did that which was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that David his father had done.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of Jehovah, and repaired them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said to them, Hear me, ye Levites. Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Jehovah, the God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah, and turned their backs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore the wrath of Jehovah was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">My sons, be not now negligent. For Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the Levites arose: Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites, and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel, and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">And the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah into the court of the house of Jehovah. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah. And they sanctified the house of Jehovah in eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels of it, and the table of showbread with all the vessels of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign cast away when he trespassed, we have prepared and sanctified. And, behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">So they killed the bullocks. And the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar. And they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar. They also killed the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And they brought near the he-goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly. And they laid their hands upon them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">and the priests killed them. And they made a sin offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel. For the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet. For the commandment was of Jehovah by his prophets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of Jehovah began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And all the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded. All this until the burnt offering was finished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Moreover Hezekiah the king and the rulers commanded the Levites to sing praises to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah. Come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of Jehovah. And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All these were for a burnt offering to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But the priests were too few, so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings. Therefore their brothers the Levites helped them till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves. For the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people; for the thing was done suddenly.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="30">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem, to keep the Passover to Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the king had taken counsel, and his rulers, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the Passover in the second month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passover to Jehovah, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem. For they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So the posts went with the letters from the king and his rulers throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye sons of Israel, turn again to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may return to the remnant of you who escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And be ye not like your fathers, and like your brothers, who trespassed against Jehovah, the God of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now be ye not stiff-necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to Jehovah, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified forever, and serve Jehovah your God, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For if ye turn again to Jehovah, your brothers and your sons shall find compassion before those who led them captive, and shall come again into this land. For Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun. But they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Also the hand of God came upon Judah to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the rulers by the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense they took away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then they killed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves. Therefore the Levites had charge of killing the Passovers for everyone who was not clean, to sanctify them to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than it is written. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Jehovah pardon everyone</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">who sets his heart to seek God, Jehovah, the God of his fathers, though he be not according to the purification of the sanctuary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the sons of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness. And the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day, with loud instruments to Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who had good understanding in the service of Jehovah. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace offerings, and making confession to Jehovah, the God of their fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days. And they kept those seven days with gladness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep. And the rulers gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep. And a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">So there was great joy in Jerusalem. For since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people. And their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="31">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and broke in pieces the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, also in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites after their divisions, every man according to his service, both the priests and the Levites, for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Also he appointed the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, namely, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Moreover he commanded the people who dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might give themselves to the law of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the sons of Israel gave in abundance the first-fruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field. And they brought in the tithe of all things abundantly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the sons of Israel and Judah, who dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of dedicated things which were consecrated to Jehovah their God, and laid them by heaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And when Hezekiah and the rulers came and saw the heaps, they blessed Jehovah, and his people Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Azariah the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since they began to bring the oblations into the house of Jehovah, we have eaten and had enough, and have plenty left. For Jehovah has blessed his people, and that which is left is this great store.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah, and they prepared them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they brought in the oblations and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully. And Conaniah the Levite was ruler over them, and Shimei his brother was second.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by the appointment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter at the east gate, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of Jehovah, and the most holy things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And under him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their office of trust, to give to their brothers by divisions, as well to the great as to the small,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">besides those who were reckoned by genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even everyone that entered into the house of Jehovah, as the duty of every day required, for their service in their offices according to their divisions,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">and those who were reckoned by genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation. For in their office of trust they sanctified themselves in holiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all who were reckoned by genealogy among the Levites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah. And he wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And he took courage, and built up all the wall that was broken down, and raised it up to the towers, and the other wall outside, and strengthened Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in abundance.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you after this manner, neither believe ye him. For no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my fathers. How much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And his servants spoke yet more against Jehovah God, and against his servant Hezekiah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">He also wrote letters, to rail on Jehovah, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands, which have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall the God of Hezekiah not deliver his people out of my hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them, and to trouble them, that they might take the city.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And he set the graven image of the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="22">For I was ashamed to ask of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all those who seek him, for good, but his power and his wrath are against all those who forsake him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he was entreated by us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then I set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">and weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his rulers, and all Israel there present, had offered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred talents of silver vessels, a hundred talents of gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">and twenty bowls of gold, of a thousand darics, and two vessels of fine bright brass, precious as gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And I said to them, Ye are holy to Jehovah, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Jehovah, the God of your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the rulers of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Then we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. And the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the ambushment by the way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas, and with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, the Levite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">the whole by number and by weight. And all the weight was written at that time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">The sons of the captivity, who came out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when these things were done, the rulers drew near to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands. Yea, the hand of the heads and rulers has been chief in this trespass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And when I heard this thing, I tore my garment and my robe, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down confounded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel were assembled to me, because of the trespass of those of the captivity, and I sat confounded until the evening oblation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Since the days of our fathers we have been exceedingly guilty to this day.

      <VERS vnumber="8">And now for a little moment grace has been shown from Jehovah our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken thy commandments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">which thou have commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their filthiness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters to your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever, that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your sons forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great guilt, seeing that thou our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have given us such a remnant,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">shall we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the peoples who do these abominations? Would thou not be angry with us till thou had consumed us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">O Jehovah, the God of Israel, thou are righteous, for we are left a remnant that is escaped, as it is this day. Behold, we are before thee in our guiltiness, for none can stand before thee because of this.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days. And I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou may hearken to the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the sons of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the sons of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father's house have sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commanded thy servant Moses.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">and all of them together conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens has become feeble, and there is much rubbish, so that we are not able to build the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the work to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it came to pass that, when the Jews who dwelt by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where ye shall return to us they will be upon you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore I set in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set there the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I looked, and rose up, and said to the ranking men, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to naught, that we returned all of us to the wall, every man to his work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants labored in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail. And the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They all built the wall, and those who bore burdens loaded themselves, every man with one of his hands labored in the work, and with the other held his weapon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and the builders, every man had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he who sounded the trumpet was by me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I said to the ranking men, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">In whatever place ye hear the sound of the trumpet, gather ye there to us, our God will fight for us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">So we labored in the work, and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Likewise at the same time I said to the people, Let each with his servant lodge within Jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, everyone went with his weapon to the water.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For there were who said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain that we may eat and live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">There were some also who said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain because of the dearth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">There were also who said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute upon our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our sons as their sons. And, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage already. Neither is it in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the ranking men and the rulers, and said to them, Ye exact usury, everyone of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I said to them, According to our ability we have redeemed our brothers the Jews, who were sold to the nations, and would ye even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us? Then they were silent, and found not a word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them, so will we do, even as thou say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath from them that they would do according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, who does not perform this promise, even thus be he shaken out and emptied. And all the assembly said, Truly, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">But the former governors who were before me charged the people, and took bread and wine from them, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people. But I did not so, because of the fear of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any land. And all my servants were gathered there to the work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were round about us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep, also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this I did not demand the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Remember to me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it, and come down to you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And they sent to me four times after this sort, and I answered them after the same manner.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">in which was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou are building the wall. And thou would be their king according to these words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And thou have also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah. And now it shall be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as thou say, but thou imagine them out of thine own heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work that it not be done. But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up, and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple. For they will come to kill thee, yea, they will come to kill thee in the night.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him, but he pronounced this prophecy against me, and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For this cause he was hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, who would have put me in fear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard of it, that all the nations that were around us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes, for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover in those days the ranking men of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For there were many in Judah sworn to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem, for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot, and while they stand on guard, let them shut the doors, and bar ye them. And appoint watchmen of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, everyone in his watch, and everyone to be opposite his house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the city was wide and large, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not built.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And my God put into my heart to gather together the ranking men, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first. And I found written therein:</VERS>

And in their rebellion they appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and did not forsake them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Yea, when they had made a molten calf for them, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">yet thou in thy manifold mercies did not forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not depart from over them by day to lead them in the way, neither the pillar of fire by night to show them light, and the way in which they should go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Thou also gave thy good Spirit to instruct them, and did not withhold thy manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yea, forty years thou sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing; their clothes did not grow old, and their feet did not swell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Moreover thou gave them kingdoms and peoples, which thou allotted after their portions. So they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Their sons thou also multiplied as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land concerning which thou said to their fathers that they should go in to possess it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So the sons went in and possessed the land. And thou subdued the inhabitants of the land before them, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and killed thy prophets who testified against them to turn them again to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore thou delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them. And in the time of their trouble, when they cried to thee, thou heard from heaven, and according to thy manifold mercies thou gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But after they had rest, they again did evil before thee. Therefore thou left them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them. Yet when they returned, and cried to thee, thou heard from heaven, and many times thou delivered them according to thy mercies,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">and testified against them, that thou might bring them again to thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and did not hearken to thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances (which if a man does, he shall live in them), and withdrew the shoulder, and stiffened their neck, and would not hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Yet many years thou bore with them, and testified against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets. Yet they would not give ear. Therefore thou gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them, for thou are a gracious and merciful God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our rulers, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">However thou are just in all that has come upon us, for thou have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">neither have our kings, our rulers, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened to thy commandments and thy testimonies with which thou testified against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gave them, and in the large and fat land which thou gave before them, neither did they turn from their wicked works.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we are servants in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And it yields much increase to the kings whom thou have set over us because of our sins. Also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">There dwelt men of Tyre also in it who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then I contended with the ranking men of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants over the gates that there should be no burden brought in on the sabbath day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye lodge outside the wall? If ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the sabbath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember to me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy loving kindness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And their sons spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet there was no king like him among many nations, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">that in those days, when king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his rulers and his servants, the power of Persia and Media, the ranking men and rulers of the provinces, being before him</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days, even a hundred and eighty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when these days were fulfilled, the king made a feast to all the people who were present in Shushan the palace, both great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">There were hangings of white cloth, of green, and of blue, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble. The couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and white and yellow and black marble.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another), and royal wine in abundance according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the drinking was according to the law, none could compel. For so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains who ministered in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown to show the peoples and the rulers her beauty, for she was fair to look on.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by the chamberlains. Therefore the king was very angry, and his fury burned in him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times (for so was the king's manner toward all who knew law and judgment,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven rulers of Persia and Media who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">What shall we do to queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done the bidding of king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Memucan answered before the king and the rulers, Vashti the queen has not done wrong only to the king, but also to all the rulers, and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For this deed of the queen will come abroad to all women, to make their husbands contemptible in their eyes when it shall be reported, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she did not come.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And this day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen will say the like to all the king's rulers. So there will arise much contempt and wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">If it please the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal estate to another who is better than she.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give to their husbands honor, both to great and small.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the saying pleased the king and the rulers, and the king did according to the word of Memucan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and should speak according to the language of his people.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then the king's servants who ministered to him said, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, to the custody of Hegai the king's chamberlain, keeper of the women. And let their things for purification be given them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">There was a certain Jew in Shushan the palace whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter. For she had neither father nor mother, and the maiden was fair and beautiful. And when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was taken into the king's house to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. And he quickly gave her things for purification, with her portions, and the seven maidens who were suitable to be given her out of the king's house. And he removed her and her maidens to the best place of the house of the women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Esther had not made known her people nor her kindred, for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how Esther did, and what would become of her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Now when the turn of every maiden came to go in to king Ahasuerus, after it had been done to her according to the law for the women twelve months (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, namely, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odors and with the things for the purifying of the women),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">then the maiden came to the king in this way: Whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the king loved Esther above all the women. And she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Then the king made a great feast to all his rulers and his servants, even Esther's feast, and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts according to the bounty of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Esther had not yet made known her kindred nor her people, as Mordecai had charged her. For Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, two of the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the threshold, were angry, and sought to lay hands on king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the thing became known to Mordecai, who showed it to Esther the queen, and Esther told the king of it in Mordecai's name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And when inquiry was made of the matter, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a tree. And it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the rulers that were with him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And all the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, bowed down, and did reverence to Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not bow down, nor do him reverence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate, said to Mordecai, Why do thou transgress the king's commandment?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he did not hearken to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's matters would stand, for he had told them that he was a Jew.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not bow down, nor do him reverence, then Haman was full of wrath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are diverse from those of every people, nor do they keep the king's laws. Therefore it is not for the king's profit to endure them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed. And I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have the charge of the king's business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the king's scribes were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day of it. And there was written according to all that Haman commanded to the king's satraps, and to the governors who were over every province, and to the rulers of every people, to every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, in the name of king Ahasuerus it was written. And it was sealed with the king's ring.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little sons and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">A copy of the writing that the decree should be given out in every province was published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The posts went forth in haste by the king's commandment, and the decree was given out in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Shushan was perplexed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now when Mordecai knew all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he came even before the king's gate, for none might enter inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in every province, wherever the king's commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing, and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esther's maidens and her chamberlains came and told it to her. And the queen was exceedingly grieved. And she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take his sackcloth from off him, but he did not receive it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and charged him to go to Mordecai, to know what this was, and why it was.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Hathach went forth to Mordecai to the broad place of the city, which was before the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews to destroy them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to declare it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces, know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live. But I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they told Esther's words to Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then Mordecai bade them return answer to Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shall escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For if thou altogether keep quiet at this time, then relief and deliverance will arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father's house will perish. And who knows whether thou have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then Esther bade them return answer to Mordecai,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day. I also and my maidens will fast in like manner. And so I will go in to the king, which is not according to the law. And if I perish, I perish.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's house, opposite the king's house. And the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the entrance of the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favor in his sight, and the king held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the scepter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then the king said to her, What will thou, queen Esther? And what is thy request? It shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Esther said, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste that it may be done as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? And it shall be granted thee. And what is thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Esther answered, and said, My petition and my request is,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">if I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Haman went forth that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he did not stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home, and he sent and fetched his friends and Zeresh his wife.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his sons, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the rulers and servants of the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself, and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the morning speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it. Then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the gallows to be made.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that night the king could not sleep. And he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, of those who kept the threshold, who had sought to lay hands on king Ahasuerus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the king said, What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this? Then the king's servants who ministered to him said, There is nothing done for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman came into the outward court of the king's house to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the king's servants said to him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">So Haman came in. And the king said to him, What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor? Now Haman said in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honor more than to myself?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Haman said to the king, For the man whom the king delights to honor,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">let royal apparel be brought which the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides upon, and on the head of which a royal crown is set.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And let the apparel and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most noble rulers, that they may array the man therewith whom the king delights to honor, and cause him to ride on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou have said, and do even so to Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Let nothing fail of all that thou have spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then Haman took the apparel and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and caused him to ride through the street of the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hastened to his house, mourning and having his head covered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, If Mordecai, before whom thou have begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews, thou shall not prevail against him, but shall surely fall before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">While they were yet talking with him, the king's chamberlains came, and hastened to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? And it shall be granted thee. And what is thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's damage.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then king Ahasuerus spoke and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, who dares presume in his heart to do so?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. And Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen, for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine, and Haman was fallen upon the couch on which Esther was. Then the king said, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Harbonah, one of the chamberlains who were before the king said, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath was pacified.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">On that day king Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman the Jews' enemy to Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood before the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And she said, If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king's provinces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="18" bname="Job" bsname="Job">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was perfect and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-donkeys, and a very great household, so that this man was the greatest of all the sons of the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day, and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were completed, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus Job did continually.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do thou come? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Jehovah said to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Have thou not made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has, on every side? Thou have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in thy power, only upon himself do not put forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">that there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away. Yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God fell from heaven, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead, and only I alone have escaped to tell thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshiped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he said, Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there. Jehovah gave, and Jehovah has taken away, blessed be the name of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">In all this Job did not sin, nor foolishly accuse God.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Jehovah said to Satan, From where did thou come? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Jehovah said to Satan, Have thou considered my servant Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, although thou moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man has he will give for his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand, only spare his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to his crown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And he took a potsherd for him to scrape himself with it, and he sat among the ashes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then his wife said to him, Do thou still hold fast thine integrity? Renounce God, and die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">But he said to her, Thou speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that came upon him, they came each one from his own place-Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite-and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice, and wept. And each one tore his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights. And none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And Job answered and said,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Let the day perish in which I was born, and the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Let that day be darkness. Let not God from above seek for it, nor let the light shine upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell upon it. Let blackness come upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Lo, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come in it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, nor let it behold the eyelids of the morning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For now I should have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept. Then I would have been at rest</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">The small and the great are there. And the servant is free from his master.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hid treasures,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad when they can find the grave?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God has hedged in?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For my sighing comes before I eat, and my groanings are poured out like water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For the thing which I fear comes upon me, and that which I am afraid of comes to me.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="8">Now therefore, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams. And go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for him I will accept, that I not deal with you after your folly. For ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did according as Jehovah commanded them, and Jehovah accepted Job.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Then there came to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him. Each man also gave him a piece of money, and each one a ring of gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-donkeys.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He had also seven sons and three daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he called the name of the first, Jemimah, and the name of the second, Keziah, and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">What profit has man from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">One generation goes, and another generation comes, but the earth abides forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The sun also arises, and the sun goes down and hastens to its place where it arises.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually in its course, and the wind returns again to its circuits.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place from where the rivers come, there they go again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">All things are full of weariness, man cannot utter it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">That which has been is that which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be done. And there is no new thing under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Is there a thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">There is no remembrance of the former things, nor shall there be any remembrance of the latter that are to come, among those who shall come after.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven. It is a great tribulation that God has given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and, behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">I communed with my own heart, saying, Lo, I have gotten for me great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yea, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For in much wisdom is much grief, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure. And, behold, this also was vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I said of laughter, It is mad, and of mirth, What does it do?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine (my heart yet guiding me with wisdom), and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I made for me great works. I built for me houses. I planted for me vineyards.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">I made for me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">I made for me pools of water, to water from there the forest where trees were reared.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">I bought men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">I also gathered for me silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got for me men-singers and women-singers, and the luxuries of the sons of men, and a wife and wives.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them. I did not withhold my heart from any joy. For my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion from all my labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do, and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And I turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Even that which has been done long ago.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Then I saw that wisdom excels folly as far as light excels darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it will happen even to me, and why then was I more wise? Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance forever, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how the wise man dies even as the fool!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous to me. For all is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who shall be after me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skillfulness, yet he shall leave it to a man who has not labored in it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart in which he labors under the sun?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief, yea, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, without him?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For to the man who pleases him God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">a time to be born, and a time to die, a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">a time to kill, and a time to heal, a time to break down, and a time to build up,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">a time to weep, and a time to laugh, a time to mourn, and a time to dance,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together, a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">a time to seek, and a time to lose, a time to keep, and a time to cast away,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">a time to tear, and a time to sew, a time to keep silence, and a time to speak,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">a time to love, and a time to hate, a time for war, and a time for peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men to be employed therewith.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also he has set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor. It is the gift of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I know that, whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it. And God has done it that men should fear before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">That which is, has been long ago, and that which is to be, has long ago been. And God seeks again that which has passed away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there, and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous man and the wicked man, for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are beasts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts, even one thing befalls them; as the one dies, so dies the other. Yea, they all have one breath, and man has no preeminence above the beasts; for all is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">All go to one place. All are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goes downward to the earth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works, for that is his portion. For who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him?</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun. And, behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter. And on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Therefore I praised the dead who have long been dead more than the living who are yet alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Yea, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Then I saw all labor and every skilful work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The fool folds his hands together, and eats his own flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">There is one man who is alone, and he has not a second, yea, he has neither son nor brother. Yet there is no end of all his labor, nor are his eyes satisfied with riches. For whom then, he says, do I labor, and deprive my soul of good? This also is vanity, yea, it is a great travail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow, but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and has not another to lift him up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth, but how can one be warm alone?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And if a man prevails against him who is alone, two shall withstand him. And a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who does not know how to receive admonition any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">For he came forth out of prison to be king, yea, even in his kingdom he was born poor.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the second, who stood up in his stead.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">There was no end of all the people, even of all those over whom he was. Yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="5">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Keep thy foot when thou go to the house of God, for to draw near to hear is better than to give the sacrifice of fools. For they know not that they do evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth. Therefore let thy words be few.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For a dream comes with a multitude of business, and a fool's voice with a multitude of words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">When thou vow a vow to God, defer not to pay it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which thou vow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Better is it that thou should not vow, than that thou should vow and not pay.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Do not allow thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, nor say thou before the agent, that is was an error. Why should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, and in many words. But fear thou God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">If thou see the oppression of a poor man, and the violent wresting of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter. For a man higher than the high is observing, and there are higher men than they.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Moreover the abundance of the land is for all. The king himself is served by the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance, with increase. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When goods increase, they are increased who eat them. And what advantage is there to the owner of it, except the beholding of them with his eyes?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the fullness of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: Riches were kept by the owner of it to his hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And those riches perish in a bad venture. And if he has begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit has he that he labored for the wind?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">All his days also he eats in gloom, and he is greatly troubled, and has depression and anger.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Behold, that which I have seen to be good and to be fitting is for a man to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor in which he labors under the sun all the days of his life which God has given him, for this is his portion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor-this is the gift of God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is heavy upon men:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but an alien eats it. This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">If a man begets a hundred sons, and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial, I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and the name of it is covered with darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it, this one has rest rather than the other.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Yea, though he lives a thousand years twice told, and yet enjoys no good, do not all go to one place?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For what advantage has the wise man more than the fool? What has the poor man, who knows how to walk before the living?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Whatever has been, the name of it was given long ago, and it is know what man is. Neither can he contend with him who is mightier than he.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">A good name is better than precious oil, and the day of death, than the day of birth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Sorrow is better than laughter, for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">It is better to hear the rebuke of a wise man, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Surely oppression makes the wise man foolish, and a bribe destroys the understanding.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, yea, it is more excellent for those who see the sun.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider. Yea, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">All this I have seen in my days of vanity. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evil-doing.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked, again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then I commended joy, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be cheerful. For that shall abide with him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is he who sees sleep with his eyes neither day nor night),</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. Because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he shall not find it. Yea moreover, though a wise man thinks to know it, yet he shall not be able to find it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God. No man understands, either love or hatred. All is before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">All things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous man and to the wicked man, to the good man, and to the clean man, and to the unclean man, to him who sacrifices and to him who does not sacrifice, as is the good man, so is the sinner, and he who swears, as he who fears an oath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one event to all. Yea also, the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="12">For man also does not know his time. As the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falls suddenly upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">I have also seen wisdom under the sun this way, and it seemed great to me:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">There was a little city, and few men within it. And there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now there was found in it a poor wise man. And he by his wisdom delivered the city, yet no man remembered that same poor man.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then Jehovah said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Jehovah spoke to me yet again, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Inasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces. And give ear, all ye of far countries. Gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces. Gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nothing. Speak the word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all of which this people shall say, A conspiracy, nor fear ye their fear, nor be in dread of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Jehovah of hosts, him ye shall sanctify, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And he shall be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a net and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And many shall stumble on it, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="19">And when they shall say to you, Seek for those who have familiar spirits and for the wizards, who chirp and who mutter, should not a people seek for their God? On behalf of the living seek to the dead?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Seek to the law and to the testimony! If they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they shall pass through it, greatly distressed and hungry. And it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">But there shall be no gloom to her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. Those who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light has shone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Thou have multiplied the nation. Thou have increased their joy. They joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou have broken as in the day of Midian.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even forever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The elder and the honorable man, he is the head. And the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For those who lead this people cause them to err, and those who are led by them are destroyed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, nor will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows. For everyone is profane and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For wickedness burns as the fire. It devours the briers and thorns. Yea, it kindles in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burnt up, and the people are as the fuel of fire; no man spares his brother.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write perverseness,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">For he has said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding. And I have removed the bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. And like a valiant man I have brought down those who sit on thrones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the peoples. And like a gathering of eggs that are forsaken, I have gathered all the earth. And there was none that moved the wing, or that opened the mouth, or chirped.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Shall the axe boast itself against him who hews with it? Shall the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up him who is not wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Therefore will the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, send among his fat ones, leanness, and under his glory there shall be kindled a burning like the burning of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame, and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Give counsel, execute justice, make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday. Hide the outcasts. Do not betray the fugitive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Let my outcasts dwell with thee. As for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the destroyer. For the extortioner is brought to nothing. Destruction ceases. The oppressors are consumed out of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And a throne shall be established in loving kindness, and he shall sit on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud, even of his arrogance, and his pride, and his wrath. His boastings are nothing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore Moab shall wail for Moab, everyone shall wail. Ye shall mourn for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth, utterly stricken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah. The lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches of it, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness. Its shoots were spread abroad. They passed over the sea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah. I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh. for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the battle shout has fallen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field. And in the vineyards there shall be no singing nor joyful noise. No treader shall tread out wine in the presses. I have made the vintage shout to cease.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-heres.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And it shall come to pass, when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself upon the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">This is the word that Jehovah spoke concerning Moab in time past.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">But now Jehovah has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude. And the remnant shall be very small and of no account.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Yet there shall be gleanings left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree-two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost branches of a fruitful tree, says Jehovah, the God of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">In that day men shall look to their maker, and their eyes shall have respect for the Holy One of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they shall not look to the altars, the work of their hands, nor shall they have respect for that which their fingers have made, either the Asherim, or the sun-images.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">For thou have forgotten the God of thy salvation, and have not been mindful of the rock of thy strength. Therefore thou plant pleasant plants, and set it with foreign slips.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">In the day of thy planting thou hedge it in, and in the morning thou make thy seed to blossom. But the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas, and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and he will take away and cut down the spreading branches.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They shall be left together to the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth. And the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">I say, thy counsel and strength for the war are but vain words. Now on whom do thou trust that thou have rebelled against me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Behold, thou trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">O Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, thou are the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou have made heaven and earth.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries, and their land,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">Therefore their inhabitants were of small power. They were dismayed and confounded. They were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb. As the grass on the housetops, and as a field of grain before it is grown up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But I know thy sitting down, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Because of thy raging against me, and because thine arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And this shall be the sign to thee. Ye shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same, and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion those who shall escape. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Therefore thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there. Neither shall he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">I was manifested by those who did not ask for me. I am found by those who did not seek me. I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">I have spread out my hands all the day to a disobedient and rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, according to their own thoughts,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places, who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">who say, Stand by thyself, do not come near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Behold, it is written before me. I will not keep silence, but will recompense. Yea, I will recompense into their bosom</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says Jehovah, those who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills. Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Thus says Jehovah, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and a man says, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it, so I will do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. And my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">But ye who forsake Jehovah, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mingled wine to Destiny,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter. Because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear, but ye did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry. Behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty. Behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen, and the lord Jehovah will kill thee. And he will call his servants by another name,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth, and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth. Because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">But be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create. For, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people. And there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">There shall be no more from there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days. For the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And they shall build houses, and inhabit them. And they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">They shall not build, and another inhabit. They shall not plant, and another eat. For as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity. For they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says Jehovah.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="66">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What manner of house will ye build to me, and what place shall be my rest?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For all these things my hand has made, and all these things came to be, says Jehovah. But to this man I will look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">He who slaughters an ox is as he who kills a man. He who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck. He who offers an oblation, as swine's blood. He who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them. Because when I called, none answered. When I spoke, they did not hear. But they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Hear the word of Jehovah, ye who tremble at his word: Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name's sake, have said, Let Jehovah be glorified, that we may see your joy. But it is those who shall be put to shame.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of Jehovah who renders recompense to his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Before she travailed, she brought forth. Before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says Jehovah. Shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb? says thy God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all ye who mourn over her,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">that ye may nurse and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations, that ye may get milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">For thus says Jehovah, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream. And ye shall nurse thereof. Ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass. And the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants, and he will have indignation against his enemies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For, behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind, to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">For by fire Jehovah will execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh, and the slain of Jehovah shall be many.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes, that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come, and shall see my glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory, and they shall declare my glory among the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And they shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an oblation to Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Jehovah, as the sons of Israel bring their oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me. For their worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.</VERS>

  <BIBLEBOOK bnumber="24" bname="Jeremiah" bsname="Jer">
    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away captive of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Now the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou came forth out of the womb I sanctified thee. I have appointed thee a prophet to the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then I said, Ah, lord Jehovah! Behold, I know not how to speak, for I am a child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But Jehovah said to me, Say not, I am a child. For to whomever I shall send thee thou shall go, and whatever I shall command thee thou shall speak.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Be not afraid because of them, for I am with thee to deliver thee, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then Jehovah put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And Jehovah said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what do thou see? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then Jehovah said to me, Thou have well seen. For I watch over my word to perform it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying, What do thou see? And I said, I see a boiling caldron, and the face of it is from the north.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then Jehovah said to me, Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah. And they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls of it round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee. Be not dismayed at them, lest I dismay thee before them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">For, behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the rulers of it, against the priests of it, and against the people of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And they shall fight against thee. But they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, says Jehovah, to deliver thee.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, how thou went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Israel was holiness to Jehovah, the first-fruits of his increase. All who devour him shall be held guilty. Evil shall come upon them, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus says Jehovah: What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and have become vain?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Nor did they say, Where is Jehovah who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought and of the shadow of death, through a land that none passed through, and where no man dwelt?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I brought you into a plentiful land, to eat the fruit of it and the goodness of it. But when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">The priests did not say, Where is Jehovah? And those who handle the law did not know me. The rulers also transgressed against me. And the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore I will yet contend with you, says Jehovah, and I will contend with your son's sons.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see, and send to Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there has been such a thing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Has a nation changed its gods, which yet are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid. Be ye very desolate, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For my people have committed two evils: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Is Israel a servant? Is he a homebred one? Why has he become a prey?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The young lions have roared upon him, and yelled, and they have made his land waste. His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The sons also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of thy head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Have thou not procured this to thyself, in that thou have forsaken Jehovah thy God when he led thee by the way?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And now what have thou to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have thou to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee. Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter, that thou have forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, says the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">For from old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bonds. And thou said, I will not serve, for upon every high hill and under every green tree thou bowed thyself, playing the harlot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed. How then have thou turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For though thou wash thee with lye, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, says the lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">How can thou say, I am not defiled; I have not gone after the Baalim? See thy way in the valley. Know what thou have done, a swift dromedary traversing her ways,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs up the wind in her desire. In her time of estrus who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month they shall find her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst. But thou said, It is in vain. No, for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">As the thief is shamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel shamed, they, their kings, their rulers, and their priests, and their prophets,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">who say to a block of wood, Thou are my father, and to a stone, Thou have brought me forth. For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">But where are thy gods that thou have made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble. For according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">Why will ye contend with me? Ye have all transgressed against me, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">In vain I have smitten your sons. They received no correction. Your own sword has devoured your prophets like a destroying lion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">O generation, see ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why do my people say, We have broken loose. We will come no more to thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">How thou trim thy way to seek love! Therefore even the wicked women thou have taught thy ways.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor. Thou did not find them breaking in. But it is because of all these things.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Yet thou said, I am innocent. Surely his anger is turned away from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee because thou say, I have not sinned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Why do thou gad about so much to change thy way? Thou shall be ashamed of Egypt also, as thou were ashamed of Assyria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Thou shall also go forth from there with thy hands upon thy head. For Jehovah has rejected those in whom thou trust. And thou shall not prosper with them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">They say, If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and become another man's, will he return to her again? Will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou have played the harlot with many lovers. Yet return again to me, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Lift up thine eyes to the bare heights, and see. Where have thou not been lain with? By the ways thou have sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness, and thou have polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain. Yet thou have a harlot's forehead; thou refused to be ashamed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Will thou not from this time cry to me, My Father, thou are the guide of my youth?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou have spoken, and have done evil things, and have had thy way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Moreover Jehovah said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have thou seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me, but she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not, but she also went and played the harlot.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it came to pass through the frivolity of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not returned to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And Jehovah said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, says Jehovah, I will not look in anger upon you, for I am merciful, says Jehovah. I will not keep anger forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou have transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and have scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Return, O backsliding sons, says Jehovah, for I am a husband to you. And I will take you, one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says Jehovah, they shall no more say, The ark of the covenant of Jehovah, nor shall it come to mind. Neither shall they remember it, nor shall they miss it. Neither shall it be made any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah, and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem. Neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">But I said, How I will put thee among the sons, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! And I said, Ye shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so ye have dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">A voice is heard upon the bare heights, the weeping and the supplications of the sons of Israel, because they have perverted their way; they have forgotten Jehovah their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Return, ye backsliding sons, I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we have come to thee, for thou are Jehovah our God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Truly it is in vain from the heights, the multitude on the mountains. Truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us, for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah our God.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">If thou will return, O Israel, says Jehovah, if thou will return to me, and if thou will put away thine abominations out of my sight, then thou shall not be removed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And thou shall swear, As Jehovah lives, in truth, in justice, and in righteousness. And the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him they shall glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For thus says Jehovah to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Circumcise yourselves to Jehovah, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn so that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem, and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land. Cry aloud and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety, do not stay. For I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way, he has gone forth from his place, to make thy land desolate, that thy cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned back from us.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And it shall come to pass at that day, says Jehovah, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the rulers, and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then I said, Ah, lord Jehovah! Surely thou have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace, whereas the sword reaches to the life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">a full wind from these shall come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou may be saved. How long shall thine evil thoughts lodge within thee?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Make ye mention to the nations. Behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">They are as keepers of a field against her round about, because she has been rebellious against me, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Thy way and thy doings have procured these things to thee. This is thy wickedness, for it is bitter, for it reaches to thy heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart. My heart is disquieted in me. I cannot hold my peace, because thou have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Destruction upon destruction is cried, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains in a moment.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">For my people are foolish. They do not know me. They are sottish sons, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">And thou, when thou are made desolate, what will thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with scarlet, though thou deck thee with ornaments of gold, though thou enlarge thine eyes with paint, in vain thou make thyself fair. Thy lovers despise thee, they seek thy life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.</VERS>

And I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says Jehovah, and I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Because ye have said, Jehovah has raised us up prophets in Babylon,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">thus says Jehovah concerning the king who sits upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your brothers who have not gone forth with you into captivity,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">And I will pursue after them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah, all ye of the captivity whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thus says Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name. Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall kill them before your eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken words in my name falsely, which I did not command them. And I am he who knows, and am witness, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite thou shall speak, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou have sent letters in thine own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Jehovah has made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that there may be officers in the house of Jehovah, for every man who is mad, and makes himself a prophet, that thou should put him in the stocks and in shackles.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Now therefore, why have thou not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who makes himself a prophet to you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">inasmuch as he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, It is long. Build ye houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">Then the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Send to all those of the captivity, saying, Thus says Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I did not send him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">therefore thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed. He shall not have a man to dwell among this people, nor shall he behold the good that I will do to my people, says Jehovah, because he has spoken rebellion against Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why do thou prophesy, and say, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he shall bring Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him, says Jehovah. Though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come to thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth. For the right of redemption is thine to buy it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin. For the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine. Buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And I signed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, according to the law and custom, and that which was open,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="16">Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to Jehovah, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Ah lord Jehovah! Behold, thou have made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for thee,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">who show loving kindness to thousands, and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them, the great, the mighty God. Jehovah of hosts is his name,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="23">And they came in, and possessed it, but they obeyed not thy voice, nor walked in thy law. They have done nothing of all that thou commanded them to do. Therefore thou have caused all this evil to come upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Behold, the mounds. They have come to the city to take it. And the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence. And what thou have spoken has come to pass, and, behold, thou see it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And thou have said to me, O lord Jehovah, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses, whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth. For the sons of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day, that I should remove it from before my face,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their rulers, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="34">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I did not command them, nor did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And now therefore thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in great indignation. And I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their sons after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from following them, to do them good. And I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good. And I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">For thus says Jehovah: Just as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And fields shall be bought in this land, of which ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast. It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">Men shall buy fields for money, and sign the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South.

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Thus says Jehovah, the God of Israel: Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus says Jehovah: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">thou shall die in peace. And with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee. And they shall lament thee, saying, Ah lord! For I have spoken the word, says Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah, king of Judah in Jerusalem,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">But afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="14">At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to thee, and has served thee six years. Thou shall let him go free from thee. But your fathers hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And ye were now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor. And ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had let go free at their pleasure, to return. And ye brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Therefore thus says Jehovah: Ye have not hearkened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor.

If it seem good to thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will look well to thee, but if it seems ill to thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear.

      <VERS vnumber="2">Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, arose and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with him, namely, with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="9">Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah (the same was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel), Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the sons of Ammon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction. And because of great servitude she dwells among the nations. She finds no rest. All her persecutors overtook her in the distress.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">The ways of Zion mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly. All her gates are desolate. Her priests sigh. Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Her adversaries have become the head. Her enemies prosper. For Jehovah has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions. Her young sons have gone into captivity before the adversary.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed. Her rulers have become like harts that find no pasture. And they have gone without strength before the pursuer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none helped her, the adversaries saw her; they mocked at her desolations.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">the word of Jehovah came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar, and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it, as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance. They had the likeness of a man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And each one had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like burnished brass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. And those four had their faces and their wings thus:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Their wings were joined one to another. They did not turn when they went; they went each one straight forward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. And those four had the face of a lion on the right side, and those four had the face of an ox on the left side, those four also had the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And their faces and their wings were separate above, two wings of each one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they went each one straight forward. Where the spirit was to go, they went. They did not turn when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It went up and down among the living creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel was upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. And those four had one likeness, and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they went, they went in their four directions. They did not turn when they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for their rims, they were high and fearful. And those four had their rims full of eyes round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. And when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there the spirit was to go. And the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like awesome crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And under the firmament their wings were straight, the one toward the other. Each one had two which covered their bodies on this side, and each one had two which covered on that side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host. When they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. And upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward. And from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire. And there was brightness round about him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice speaking.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And he said to me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And he said to me, Son of man, go, get thee to the house of Israel, and speak to them with my words.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For thou are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">not to many peoples of a strange speech, and of a hard language, whose words thou cannot understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken to thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee, for they will not hearken to me. For all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">As an adamant, harder than flint, I have made thy forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And go, get thee to those of the captivity, to the sons of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the lord Jehovah, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched each other, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away. And I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then I came to those of the captivity at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">When I say to a wicked man, Thou shall surely die, and thou give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked man from his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet if thou warn the wicked man, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou have delivered thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because thou have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered, but I will require his blood at thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous man not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and thou have delivered thy soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me, and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will talk with thee there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain. And, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet. And he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shall not escape from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And I will make thy tongue cling to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shall be mute, and shall not be a reprover to them, for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shall say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah. He who hears, let him hear, and he who forbears, let him forbear, for they are a rebellious house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword. As a barber's razor thou shall take it to thee, and shall cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard. Then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">A third part thou shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled, and thou shall take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it, and a third part thou shall scatter to the wind. And I will draw out a sword after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And thou shall take from it a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And of these again thou shall take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire shall come forth into all the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus says the lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her, for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Because ye are more disorderly than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, nor have kept my ordinances, no, ye have not even done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and of which I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on thee, and I will scatter to all the winds the whole remnant of thee.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Therefore, as I live, says the lord Jehovah, surely, because thou have defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore I also will diminish thee, nor shall my eye spare. And I also will have no pity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and they shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee, and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee, and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Thus my anger shall be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted. And they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all who pass by.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, a lesson and an astonishment, to the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes-I, Jehovah, have spoken it-</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. And I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee. And pestilence and blood shall pass through thee. And I will bring the sword upon thee. I, Jehovah, have spoken it.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="6">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of lord Jehovah. Thus says the lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And your altars shall become desolate, and your sun-images shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And I will lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your sun-images may be hewn down, and your works may be abolished.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the slain shall fall in the midst of you. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Yet I will leave a remnant, in that ye shall have some who escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And those of you who escape shall remember me among the nations where they shall be carried captive, how I have broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the harlot after their idols. And they shall loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And they shall know that I am Jehovah. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Thus says the lord Jehovah: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">He who is far off shall die of the pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath upon them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And ye shall know that I am Jehovah when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered sweet savor to all their idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And I will stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="7">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And thou, son of man, thus says the lord Jehovah to the land of Israel: An end. The end has come upon the four corners of the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now the end is upon thee, and I will send my anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways. And I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And my eye shall not spare thee, nor will I have pity. But I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Thus says the lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil, behold, it comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">An end has come. The end has come. It awakens against thee. Behold, it comes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Thy doom has come to thee, O inhabitant of the land. The time has come. The day is near, tumult, and not joyful shouting, upon the mountains.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Now I will shortly pour out my wrath upon thee, and accomplish my anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways. And I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And my eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. I will bring upon thee according to thy ways. And thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee. And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, do smite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Behold, the day, behold, it comes. Thy doom has gone forth. The rod has blossomed; pride has budded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. Neither shall there be eminency among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">The time has come; the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all the multitude of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive, for the vision is concerning the whole multitude of it. None shall return, nor shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready, but none goes to the battle, for my wrath is upon all the multitude of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine inside. He who is in the field shall die with the sword, and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">But those of them who escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys. All of them moaning, each one in his iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them. And shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah. They shall not satisfy their souls, nor fill their bowels, because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty, but they made the images of their abominations, and their detestable things in it. Therefore I have made it as an unclean thing to them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil, and they shall profane it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">I will also turn my face from them, and they shall profane my secluded place. And robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Make the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses. I will also make the pride of the strong to cease, and their holy places shall be profaned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">Destruction comes. And they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumor shall be upon rumor. And they shall seek a vision of the prophet, but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">The king shall mourn, and the ruler shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their deserts I will judge them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="8">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the lord Jehovah fell there upon me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Then I beheld, and, lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire, from the appearance of his loins and downward, fire, and from his loins and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as it were glowing metal.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head. And the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the gate of the inner court that looks toward the north, where the seat of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the appearance that I saw in the plain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Then he said to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and, behold, northward of the gate of the altar was this image of jealousy in the entry.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And he said to me, Son of man, see thou what they do, even the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But thou shall again see yet other great abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he brought me to the door of the court. And when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Then he said to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall. And when I had dug in the wall, behold, a door.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations that they do here.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">So I went in and saw, and, behold, every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall round about.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel. And in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, each man with his censer in his hand, and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Then he said to me, Son of man, have thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each man in his chambers of imagery? For they say, Jehovah does not see us. Jehovah has forsaken the land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">He also said to me, Thou shall again see yet other great abominations which they do.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Jehovah's house which was toward the north. And, behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Then he said to me, Have thou seen this, O son of man? Thou shall again see yet greater abominations than these.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah's house. And, behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah, and their faces toward the east, and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Then he said to me, Have thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger. And, lo, they put the branch to their nose.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Therefore I will also deal in wrath. My eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity. And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="9">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause ye those who have charge over the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And, behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, each man with his slaughter weapon in his hand, and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer's case by his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And the glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, upon which it was, to the threshold of the house, and he called to the man clothed in linen who had the writer's case by his side.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Jehovah said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and who cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And to the others he said in my hearing, Go ye through the city after him, and smite. Let not your eye spare, nor have ye pity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Kill utterly the old man, the young man, and the virgin, and little sons, and women, but come not near any man upon whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the old men who were before the house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go ye forth. And they went forth, and smote in the city.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah lord Jehovah! Will thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Then he said to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness. For they say, Jehovah has forsaken the land, and Jehovah does not see.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, nor will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou have commanded me.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="10">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub, over the threshold of the house. And the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah's glory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man's hand under their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And I looked, and, behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. And the appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And as for their appearance, those four had one likeness, as if a wheel have been within a wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">When they went, they went in their four directions. They did not turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They did not turn as they went.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that those four had.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, O wheel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And each one had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third face the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them. And when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also did not turn from beside them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">When they stood, these stood, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them, for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the glory of Jehovah went forth from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went forth, and the wheels beside them. And they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah's house, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Each one had four faces, and each one four wings. And the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They went each one straight forward.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="11">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Moreover the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of Jehovah's house, which looks eastward. And, behold, at the door of the gate twenty-five men. And I saw in the midst of them Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, rulers of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he said to me, Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity, and who give wicked counsel in this city,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah lord Jehovah! Will thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Jehovah also came to me, saying,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for moving, and move by day in their sight. And thou shall move from thy place to another place in their sight. It may be they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="6">Thou shall bear it upon thy shoulder in their sight, and carry it forth in the dark. Thou shall cover thy face, that thou not see the land. For I have set thee for a sign to the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And I did so as I was commanded. I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for moving, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought it forth in the dark, and bore it upon my shoulder in their sight.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with fearfulness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And say to the people of the land, Thus says the lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with fearfulness, and drink their water in dismay, that her land may be desolate of all that is in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell therein.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Son of man, what is this proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Tell them therefore, Thus says the lord Jehovah: I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel, but say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For there shall no more be any false vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">For I am Jehovah. I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall be performed. It shall be no more deferred. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will speak the word, and will perform it, says the lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Again the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Son of man, behold, those of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many day to come, and he prophesies of times that are far off.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Therefore say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: There shall none of my words be deferred any more, but the word which I shall speak shall be performed, says the lord Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say thou to those who prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">Thus says the lord Jehovah: Woe to the foolish prophets, who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Ye have not gone up into the gaps, nor built up the wall for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">They have seen falsehood and lying divination, who say, Jehovah says, but Jehovah has not sent them. And they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Have ye not seen a false vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, in that ye say, Jehovah says, albeit I have not spoken?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Because ye have spoken falsehood, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, says the lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And my hand shall be against the prophets who see false visions, and who divine lies. They shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel.

      <VERS vnumber="12">Lo, when the wall has fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed it?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my wrath, and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to consume it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">So I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be uncovered. And it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst of it. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Thus I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon those who have daubed it with untempered mortar. And I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who daubed it,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">namely, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, says the lord Jehovah.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your pillows, with which ye hunt the souls there to make fly, and I will tear them from your arms. And I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make fly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">I will also tear your headdresses, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no more be in your hand to be hunted. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">And as for thy nativity, in the day thou were born thy navel was not cut, nor were thou washed in water to cleanse thee. Thou were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">No eye pitied thee, to do any of these things to thee, to have compassion upon thee, but thou were cast out in the open field. For thy person was abhorred, in the day that thou were born.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="4">He cropped off the topmost of the young twigs of it, and carried it to a land of merchandise. He set it in a city of merchants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil. He placed it beside many waters. He set it as a willow tree.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots of it were under him. So it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers. And, behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">It was planted in a good soil by many waters that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Say thou, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Shall it flourish? Shall he not pull up the roots of it, and cut off the fruit of it, that it may wither?

      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Jehovah came to me again, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">What do ye mean, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the son's teeth are set on edge?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">As I live, says the lord Jehovah, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Behold, all souls are mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine. The soul that sins, it shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">But if a man be just, and does that which is lawful and right,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and has not eaten upon the mountains, nor has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor has defiled his neighbor's wife, nor has come near to a woman in her impurity,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">and has not wronged any man, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to a hungry man, and has covered a naked man with a garment,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="10">If he begets a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood, and who does any one of these things,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">and who does not do any of those duties, but has even eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbor's wife,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">has wronged the poor and needy man, has taken by robbery, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="17">who has withdrawn his hand from a poor man, who has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes, he shall not die for the iniquity of his father. He shall surely live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet ye say, Why does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of a righteous man shall be upon him, and the wickedness of a wicked man shall be upon him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">But if a wicked man turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live. He shall not die.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="26">When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in it, in his iniquity that he has done, he shall die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Again, when a wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live. He shall not die.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="30">Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one according to his ways, says the lord Jehovah. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which ye have transgressed, and make you a new heart and a new spirit. For why will ye die, O house of Israel?</VERS>

Then I said I would pour out my wrath upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">But I worked for my name's sake (that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, among which they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them) in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">Son of man, say to her, Thou are a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">There is a conspiracy by her prophets in the midst of it, like a roaring lion ravening the prey. They have devoured souls. They take treasure and precious things. They have made her widows many in the midst thereof.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">Her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, nor have they caused men to discern between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Her rulers in the midst of it are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, to destroy souls, that they may get dishonest gain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered mortar, seeing false visions, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus says the lord Jehovah, when Jehovah has not spoken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery. Yea, they have vexed the poor and needy man, and have oppressed the sojourner wrongfully.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="23">
      <VERS vnumber="1">The word of Jehovah came again to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth. There their breasts were pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. And they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine, and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them. And on whomever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">Neither has she left her whoredoms since Egypt. For in her youth they lie with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity, and they poured out their whoredom upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a byword among women, for they executed judgments upon her.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, her neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And I saw that she was defiled. They both took one way.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And she increased her whoredoms, for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">girded with belts upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them rulers to look upon, according to the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love. And they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just as my soul was alienated from her sister.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">Thus thou called to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy bosom by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, rulers and men of renown, all of them riding upon horses.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And they shall come against thee with weapons, chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples. They shall set themselves against thee with buckler and shield and helmet round about. And I will commit the judgment to them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in fury. They shall take away thy nose and thine ears, and thy residue shall fall by the sword. They shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">Thus I will make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom from the land of Egypt, so that thou shall not lift up thine eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">For thus says the lord Jehovah: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of those whom thou hate, into the hand of those from whom thy soul is alienated.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare. And the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">These things shall be done to thee, because thou have played the harlot after the nations, and because thou are polluted with their idols.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">Thou have walked in the way of thy sister, therefore I will give her cup into thy hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">Thus says the lord Jehovah: Thou shall drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and large. Thou shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision. It contains much.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">Thou shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">Thou shall even drink it and drain it out. And thou shall gnaw the shards of it, and shall tear thy breasts, for I have spoken it, says the lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Because thou have forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore thou also bear thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">Jehovah said moreover to me, Son of man, will thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. And with their idols they have committed adultery. And they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through the fire for them to be devoured.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">Moreover they have done this to me: They have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">For when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it, and, lo, thus they have done in the midst of my house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And furthermore ye have sent for men who come from far, to whom a messenger was sent. And, lo, they came, for whom thou washed thyself, painted thine eyes, and decked thyself with ornaments,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">and sat upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou did set my incense and my oil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. And with men of the common sort, were brought drunkards from the wilderness, and they put bracelets upon the hands of those two women, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, Now they will play the harlot with her, and she with them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="44">And they went in to her, as they go in to a harlot. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">For thus says the lord Jehovah: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols. And ye shall know that I am the lord Jehovah.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this selfsame day; the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this selfsame day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus says the lord Jehovah: Set on the caldron. Set it on, and also pour water into it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Gather the pieces of it into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile of wood for the bones under the caldron. Make it boil well, yea, let the bones of it be boiled in the midst of it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece. No lot has fallen upon it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">For her blood is in the midst of her. She set it upon the bare rock. She did not pour it upon the ground to cover it with dust.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">Therefore thus says the lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">Heap on the wood; make the fire hot. Boil the flesh well, and make the broth thick. And let the bones be burned.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">Then set it empty upon the coals of it, that it may be hot, and the brass of it may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">She has wearied herself with toil, yet her great scum does not go forth out of her, her scum by fire.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">In thy filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed thee and thou were not cleansed, thou shall not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">I, Jehovah, have spoken it. It shall come to pass, and I will do it. I will not go back. I will neither spare, nor will I relent. According to thy ways, and according to thy doings, they shall judge thee, says the lord Jehovah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">Also the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">Son of man, behold, I take the desire of thine eyes away from thee with a stroke. Yet thou shall neither mourn nor weep. Neither shall thy tears run down.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">Sigh, but not aloud. Make no mourning for the dead. Bind thy headdress upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet. And do not cover thy lips, and do not eat the bread of men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And I did in the morning as I was commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the people said to me, Will thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou do so?</VERS>

Therefore the breadth of the house continued upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber.</VERS>
