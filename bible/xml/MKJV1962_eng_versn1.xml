    <CHAPTER cnumber="1">
      <VERS vnumber="1">In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the earth was without form and empty. And darkness [was] on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God said, Let there be light. And there was light.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And God saw the light that [it was] good. And God divided between the light and the darkness.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And God called the light, Day. And He called the darkness, Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And God said, Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters [from] the waters.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And God made the expanse, and divided the waters which [were] under the expanse from the waters which [were] above the expanse; and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And God called the expanse, Heavens. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And God called the dry land, Earth. And He called the gathering together of the waters, Seas. And God saw that [it was] good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And God said, Let the earth bring forth tender sprouts ( the] herb seeding seed [and] the fruit tree producing fruit after its kind, whose seed [is] in itself) upon the earth; and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the earth brought forth tender sprouts, [the] herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree producing fruit after its kind, whose seed [was] in itself. And God saw that [it was] good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the evening and the morning were the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to divide between the day and the night. And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth. And it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the smaller light to rule the night, and the stars [also.]</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">and to rule over the day and over the night; and to divide between the light and the darkness. And God saw that [it was] good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And God said, Let the waters swarm [with] swarmers [having] a living soul; and let birds fly over the earth on the face of the expanse of the heavens.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And God created great sea-animals, and every living soul that creeps [with] which the waters swarmed after their kind; and every winged fowl after its kind. And God saw that [it was] good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters of the seas and let the fowl multiply in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creepers, and its beasts of the earth after its kind; and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And God made the beasts of the earth after its kind, and cattle after their kind, and all creepers upon the earth after their kind. And God saw that it was good.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And God said, Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over all the creepers creeping on the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And God created man in His image; in the image of God He created him. He created them male and female.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it. And have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heavens, and all animals that move upon the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And God said, Behold! I have given you every herb seeding seed which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which [is the] fruit of a tree seeding seed; to you it shall be for food.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to every creeper on the earth which [has] in it a living soul every green plant [is] for food; and it was so.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And God saw everything that He had made, and behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="2">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made. And He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had rested from all His work which God created to make.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">These [are] the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they [were] created in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">and every shrub of the field was not yet on the earth, and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up. For the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and [there was] no man to till the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But there went up from the earth a mist and watered all the face of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the LORD God formed man [of the] dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there He put the man whom He had formed.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And out of the ground the LORD God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food. The tree of life also was in the middle of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden. And from there it was divided and became four heads.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">The name of the first [is] Pishon; that [is it] which surrounds all the land of Havilah, where [there is] gold.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the gold of that land [is] good. There [is] bdellium and the onyx stone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the name of the second river [is] Gihon; it [is] the one that surrounds the whole land of Cush.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the name of the third river [is] Tigris; it [is] that which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river [is] Euphrates.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, You may freely eat of every tree in the garden,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">but you shall not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. For in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And the LORD God said, [It is] not good that the man should be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every fowl of the air, and brought [them] to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called [each] living creature, that [was] its name.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adam gave names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field. But there was not found a suitable helper for Adam.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept. And He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh underneath.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the LORD God made the rib (which He had taken from the man) into a woman. And He brought her to the man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Adam said, This [is] now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. [She] shall be called Woman because [she] was taken out of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife and they shall be one flesh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife; and they were not ashamed.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="3">
      <VERS vnumber="1">Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, [Is it] so that God has said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">But of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the middle of the garden, God has said, You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">for God knows that in the day you eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And when the woman saw that the tree [was] good for food, and that it was pleasing to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make wise, she took of its fruit, and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the eyes of both of them were opened. And they knew that they [were] naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made girdles for themselves.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God in the middle of the trees of the garden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD God called to Adam and said to him, Where [are] you?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he said, I heard Your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I [am] naked, and I hid myself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And He said, Who told you that you [were] naked? Have you eaten of the tree which I commanded you that you should not eat?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And the man said, The woman whom You gave [to be] with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the LORD God said to the woman, What [is] this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because you have done this you [are] cursed more than all cattle, and more than every animal of the field. You shall go upon your belly, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He will bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">To the woman He said, I will greatly increase your sorrow and your conception. In pain you shall bear sons, and your desire shall be toward your husband, and he shall rule over you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And to Adam He said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You shall not eat [of] it! The ground [is] cursed for your sake. In pain shall you eat of it all the days of your life.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">It shall also bring forth thorns and thistles to you, and you shall eat the herb of the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you [are], and to dust you shall return.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And for Adam and his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and clothed them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And the LORD God said, Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he had been taken.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And He drove out the man. And He placed cherubs at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="4">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Adam knew Eve his wife. And she conceived and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And she bore again, his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And in the end of days, it happened, Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And the LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">but He did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain glowed with anger, and his face fell.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the LORD said to Cain, Why have you angrily glowed? And why did your face fall?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">If you do well, shall you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin crouches at the door; and its desire [is] for you, and you shall rule over it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And Cain talked with his brother Abel. And it happened when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] your brother Abel? And he said, I do not know. [Am] I my brother's keeper?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And He said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to Me from the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now you [are] cursed more than the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">When you till the ground, it will not again give its strength to you. And you shall be a vagabond and a fugitive in the earth.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Behold! You have driven me out from the face of the earth today, and I shall be hidden from Your face. And I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth, and it shall be [that] anyone who finds me shall kill me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain shall be avenged seven times. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain so that anyone who found him should not kill him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and lived in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Irad was born to Enoch. And Irad fathered Mehujael. And Mehujael fathered Methusael. And Methusael fathered Lamech.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Lamech took two wives to himself. The name of the first one [was] Adah, and the name of the other [was] Zillah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and with cattle.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And his brother's name [was] Jubal; he was the father of all those playing the harp and the organ.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Zillah also bore Tubalcain, [the] hammerer of every engraving tool of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have killed a man because of my wound, and a young man because of my hurt.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">For Cain is avenged seven times, and Lamech seventy-seven times.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And Adam knew his wife again. And she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For she said, God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain killed him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And there was also a son born to Seth, and he called his name Enos. Then men began to call upon the name of the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And it shall be, the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall blossom. And I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the sons of Israel by which they murmur against you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their rulers gave to him a rod, for each ruler, one rod for each ruler, for their father's house, twelve rods. And the rod of Aaron [was] among their rods.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And the people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For [there is] no bread, neither is there any water. And our soul hates this light bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people. And many people of Israel died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD that He take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the LORD said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole. And it shall be when everyone that is bitten, when he looks upon it, he shall live.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="11">And they pulled up from Oboth and pitched at Ije-abarim in the wilderness before Moab, toward the sunrising.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">From there they pulled up and pitched in the valley of Zered.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">From there they pulled up and pitched on the other side of Arnon, in the wilderness that comes out of the borders of the Amorites; for Arnon [is] in the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, Waheb in Suphah, and in the torrents of Arnon,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="18">The well which the rulers dug, which the nobles of the people dug with their staves by [the word] of the Lawgiver. And from the wilderness [they went] to Mattanah,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And Israel took all these cities. And Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon, and in all its villages.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">For Heshbon [was] the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took its villages and drove out the Amorites who [were] there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And the LORD said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">Only be strong and very courageous so that you may be careful to do according to all the law which My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may act wisely wherever you go.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it by day and by night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall act wisely.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joshua made sharp knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And this [is] the reason why Joshua circumcised. All the people that came out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the wayside, after they came out of Egypt.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="25">And all who fell that day, both of men and women, [were] twelve thousand, all the men of Ai.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her. And she wept and did not eat.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And these [are] the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said:</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me, and His word [was] in my tongue.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">The God of Israel said, The Rock of Israel spoke to me: he who rules over men justly, ruling [in] the fear of God,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">is as the light of the morning, as the sun rises, a morning without clouds. The tender grass [springs] out of the earth through shining after rain.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">Although my house [is] not so with God, yet He has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. For all my salvation, and all my desire, will He not make it grow?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">But the wicked, all of them, [shall be] like a thorn thrust away, because they cannot be taken by the hand.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But the man who shall touch them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear. And they shall be utterly burned in [their] place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">These [are] the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief of the three; he [was called] Adino the Eznite, because of the eight hundred [he] killed at one time.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there to battle; and the men of Israel had gone up;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">[he] arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary, and until his hand clung to the sword. And the LORD worked a great victory that day. And the people returned after him only to spoil.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And next [was] Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where there was a piece of ground full of lentils. And the people fled from the Philistines.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But he stood in the middle of the ground and delivered it, and killed the Philistines. And the LORD worked a great victory.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Adullam. And the troop of the Philistines pitched in the Valley of the Giants.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David [was] then in a stronghold, and the fort of the Philistines [was] then in Bethlehem.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And David longed and said, Oh that someone would give me a drink from the water of the well of Bethlehem by the gate!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David. But he would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this. [Is it not] the blood of the men who went [in danger of] their lives? And he would not drink it. These three mighty men did these [things].</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Abishai the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, [was] chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred [and] killed [them], and had the name among three.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">Surely he was honored more than the three. And he was their commander. However he did not attain to the [first] three.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada from Kabzeel, a son of a mighty man, great [in] deeds. He killed two lion-like men of Moab. He went down also and killed a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he killed an Egyptian, a man of form. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with his own spear.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty ones.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">He was more honorable than the thirty, but he did not attain to the [first] three. And David set him over his guard.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">Asahel the brother of Joab [was] of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem;</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="24">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He moved David against them to say, Go count Israel and Judah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">For the king said to Joab the commander of the army, who [was] with him, Go around through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and count the people so that I may know the number of the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And Joab said to the king, And may the LORD your God add to the people however many they be, a hundred times as many, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">But the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the commanders of the army. And Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And they passed over Jordan and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that [is] in the middle of the Valley of Gad, and to Jazer.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi. And they came to Dan-jaan, and around to Sidon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they came to the stronghold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites and [of] the Canaanites; and went out to the south of Judah, to Beer-sheba.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And they went to and fro through all the land, and came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king. And there were in Israel eight hundred thousand strong men who drew the sword. And the men of Judah [were] five hundred thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And David's heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, I have sinned greatly in what I have done. And now, I beseech You, O LORD, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And David rose up in the morning. And the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">Go and say to David, So says the LORD, I offer you three [things]. Choose one of them, so that I may do [it] to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come upon you and on your land? Or will you flee three months before your enemies while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' plague in your land? And advise, and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And David said to Gad, I [am] in great distress. Let us fall now into the hand of the LORD, for His mercies [are] great. And do not let me fall into the hand of man.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the LORD sent a plague upon Israel from the morning even till the time appointed. And there died from the people, from Dan to Beer-sheba, seventy thousand men.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD turned from the evil, and said to the angel who destroyed the people, Enough! And stay your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing-place of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">And David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who struck the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? I pray You, let Your hand be against me and against my father's house.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up! Rear an altar to the LORD in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And David went up, according to the saying of Gad, as the LORD commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out and bowed before the king, his face to the ground.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And Araunah said, Why has my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing-floor from you, to build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague may be stayed from the people.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what [seems] good to him. Behold, oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments, and instruments of the oxen for wood.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">All these Araunah, like a king, gave to the king. And Araunah said to the king, May the LORD your God accept you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And the king said to Araunah, No, but I will surely buy from you at a price. And I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God [of that which costs me] nothing. And David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="1">And King David was old, going on in days. And they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and let her nurse him, and let her lie in your bosom, so that my lord the king may get heat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And they sought out a beautiful girl throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag, a Shunammite. And they brought her to the king.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="13">Go up and go in to King David, and say to him, My lord, O king, did you not swear to your handmaid, saying, Surely your son Solomon shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="3">And keep the charge of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His judgments, and His testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn yourself,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="5">And also you know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, that he murdered them, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle on his loins, and in his shoes on his feet.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And you shall do according to your wisdom and shall not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table. For so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And, behold, with you [is] Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me [with] a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim.

      <VERS vnumber="25">And King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And he fell on him so that he died.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Go to Anathoth, to your fields, for you [are] worthy of death. But I will not put you to death at this time, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because you have been afflicted in all [that in which] my father was afflicted.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to the LORD, so that he might fulfil the word of the LORD which He spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And he made ten bases of bronze, four cubits the length of the one base, and four cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the work of the bases [was] this [way]: they had borders, and the borders were between the stays.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And on the borders that [were] between the ledges [were] lions, oxen, and cherubs. And a pedestal was on the stays above. And beneath the lions and oxen [were] wreaths of hanging-work.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And the one base had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze. And its four feet [were] supports to them; under the basin were casted supports [with] wreaths at each side.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="44">and one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="45">and the pots, and the shovels, and the basins. All these vessels which Hiram made for King Solomon for the house of the LORD [were of] burnished bronze.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="46">The king cast them in the plain of Jordan, in the thick soil of the ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="47">And Solomon left all the vessels [unweighed] because [they were] exceeding many; the weight of the bronze was not searched out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="48">And Solomon made all the vessels in the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold on which [was] the Bread of the Presence;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="49">and the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right and five on the left, in front of the Holy of Holies, with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs [of] gold,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="50">and the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the fire-pans [of] pure gold, and the hinges of gold for the doors of the inner house, the Holy of Holies, and for the doors of the house, the temple.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="51">So all the work that King Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated: the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, he had put into the treasuries of the house of the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="2">of the nations which the LORD had said to the sons of Israel, You shall not go in to them, and they shall not go in to you; surely they will turn away your heart after their gods. Solomon clung to these in love.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. And his wives turned away his heart.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">For it happened when Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart after other gods. And his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as [was] the heart of David his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">For Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">and Solomon did evil in the sight of Jehovah, and did not [go] fully after the LORD like his father David.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill which [is] before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the sons of Ammon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And likewise he did for all his foreign wives, and burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And the LORD [was] angry with Solomon because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; and he did not keep that which the LORD commanded.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And the LORD said to Solomon, Since this is done by you, and since you have not kept My covenant and My statutes which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">But I will not do it in your days, for David your father's sake, [but] I will tear it out of the hand of your son.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">Only, I will not tear away all the kingdom, [but] I will give one tribe to your son for David My servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">And it happened the LORD stirred up a foe to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He [was] of the king's seed in Edom.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">For it happened when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army had gone up to bury the slain, after he had stricken every male in Edom--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">for Joab remained there six months with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom--</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">it happened that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go to Egypt, Hadad [being] still a little child.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And they arose out of Midian and came to Paran. And [they] took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and appointed food for him, and gave him land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him the sister of his own wife for a wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, even Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart so that I may go to my own land.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">And Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me that, behold, you seek to go to your land? And he answered, Nothing; however, you shall certainly send me away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">And God stirred up [another] foe, to him, Rezon the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">And he gathered men to him, and became head over a band when David killed them. And they went to Damascus and lived in it, and reigned in Damascus.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And he was a foe to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief which Hadad [did]. And he hated Israel and reigned over Syria.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name [was] Zeruah, a widow, he too lifted up [his] hand against the king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And this [was] the cause that he lifted up [his] hand against the king. Solomon built Millo [and] repaired the breaks of the city of David his father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And the man Jeroboam [was] a mighty man of war. And Solomon, seeing that the young man was doing work, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And it happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh found him in the way. And he had clothed himself with a new garment. And the two of them [were] alone in the field.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And Ahijah caught hold of the new robe on him, and tore it [in] twelve pieces.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And he said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces for yourself. For so says the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">but he shall have one tribe for My servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">because they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the goddess of the sons of Ammon, and have not walked in My ways, to do [what is right] in My eyes, and to keep My statutes and My judgments, as David his father did.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David My servant, whom I chose, because he kept My commandments and My statutes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="35">But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, ten tribes.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="36">And to his son I will give one tribe, so that David My servant may have a light always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for Me, to put My name there.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="37">And I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="38">And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in My ways, and do [what is] right in My sight, to keep My statutes and My commandments, as David My servant did, it shall happen that I will be with you and build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="39">And for this I will afflict the seed of David, but not forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="40">And Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="41">And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, [are] they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="42">And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel [were] forty years.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="43">And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam reigned in his place.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="12">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And Rehoboam went to Shechem. For all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And it happened when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, heard, he being still in Egypt; for he had fled from the presence of King Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt;</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">Your father made our yoke hard. And now lighten the hard service of your father, and the heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">And he said to them, Go; yet in three days come back to me. And the people went away.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And king Rehoboam talked with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he still lived, and said, How do you advise to return a word to this people?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And they spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">But he left the counsel of the old men which they had advised him, and talked with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">And he said to them, What advice do you give that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke which your father put on us?</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, So shall you speak to this people who spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make [it] lighter for us, so you shall say to them: My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And now my father loaded you with a heavy yoke, and I will add to your yoke. My father has whipped you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And they came, Jeroboam and all the people, to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And the king answered the people roughly, and left the old men's advice which they advised him,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="14">and spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke. My father whipped you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="15">And the king did not listen to the people, for the cause was from the LORD, that He might perform His saying which the LORD spoke by Ahijah of Shiloh to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, and the people answered the king, saying, What part do we have in David? Yea, [there is] no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Now see to your house, O David! And Israel went to its tents.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">[As for] the sons of Israel, those living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who [was] over the tribute. And all Israel stoned him with stones so that he died. And King Rehoboam made haste to go up to get into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And it happened when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come again, they sent and called him to the company, and made him king over all Israel. There was none who followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, and he gathered all the house of Judah with the tribe of Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="23">Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, saying,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="24">So says the LORD, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the sons of Israel. Each man return to his house. For this thing is from Me. And they listened to the word of the LORD and turned to go back, according to the word of the LORD.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="32">And Jeroboam ordered a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that [is] in Judah. And he offered on the altar.

      <VERS vnumber="33">And he offered on the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in the month which he had devised out of his own heart. And he ordered a feast for the sons of Israel. And he offered on the altar, and burned incense.</VERS>
    </CHAPTER>
    <CHAPTER cnumber="13">
      <VERS vnumber="1">And behold, a man of God came out of Judah, by the word of the LORD, to Bethel. And Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="2">And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD and said, O, altar, altar, so says the LORD. Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and on you he shall offer the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and men's bones shall be burned on you.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="3">And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This [is] the sign which the LORD has spoken. Behold, the altar shall be torn apart, and the ashes that [are] on it shall be poured out.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="4">And it happened when King Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God who had cried against the altar in Bethel, he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him! And his hand, which he put forth against him withered up so that he could not pull it in again to himself.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="5">The altar also was torn apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="6">And the king answered and said to the man of God, Seek now the face of the LORD your God, and pray for me, and my hand may be given back to me again. And the man of God prayed to the LORD, and the king's hand was given back to him again, and became as at the beginning.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="7">And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">And the man of God said to the king, If you will give me half your house, I will not go in with you, nor will I eat bread nor drink water in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="9">For so was it commanded me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread nor drink water, nor return again by the same way that you came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="10">And he went another way, and did not return by the way he came to Bethel.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="11">And a certain old prophet was living in Bethel, and his son came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. The words which he had spoken to the king they also told to their father.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="12">And their father said to them, Where [is] this [man]? What way did he go? For his sons had seen what way the man of God, who came from Judah, had gone.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="13">And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled the ass for him, and he rode on it,</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="15">And he said to him, Come home with me and eat bread.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="16">And he said, I may not return with you nor go in with you, nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="17">For a word was to me by the word of the LORD, You shall eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that you came.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="18">And he said to him, I [am] a prophet also as you are. And an angel spoke to me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with you into your house, so that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="19">So he went back with him and ate bread in his house, and drank water.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="20">And it happened as they sat at the table, the word of the LORD came to the prophet who brought him back.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="21">And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, saying, So says the LORD, Because you have not obeyed the mouth of the LORD and have not kept the command which the LORD your God commanded you,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="22">but came back and have eaten bread and have drunk water in the place which He said to you, You shall not eat bread nor drink water, your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="24">And he left, and a lion met him by the way and killed him. And his dead body was thrown in the highway, and the ass stood by it, and the lion also stood by the body.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="25">And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown in the way, and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told [it] in the city where the old prophet lived.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="26">And when the prophet who brought him back from the way heard, he said, It [is] the man of God who did not obey the word of the LORD. And the LORD has delivered him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the LORD which He spoke to him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="27">And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle the ass for me. And they saddled it.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="28">And he went and found his body thrown in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body nor torn the ass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="29">And the prophet took up the dead body of the man of God, and laid it on the ass and brought it back. And the prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="30">And he laid his body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="31">And it happened after he had buried him, he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the tomb in which the man of God [is] buried. Lay my bones beside his bones,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="32">for the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="33">After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but turned and made priests of the high places from the lowest of the people. He who desired, he consecrated him, and he became [one] of the priests of the high places.</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="34">And this thing is the sin of the house of Jeroboam, even to blot [it] from off the face of the earth.</VERS>

    <CHAPTER cnumber="14">
      <VERS vnumber="1">At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="7">And it happened because the sons of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,</VERS>
      <VERS vnumber="8">and walked in the statutes of the nations whom the LORD cast out from before the sons of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which the nations had made.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="20">And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until He had cast them out of His sight.</VERS>

      <VERS vnumber="27">And the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Cause one of the priests whom you removed from there to go there. And they shall go and live there, and he shall teach them the way of the God of the land.</VERS>
